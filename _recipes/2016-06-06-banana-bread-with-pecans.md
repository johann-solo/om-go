## Ingredients

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 4 overripe bananas
* 1 cup sugar
* 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
* 2 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup pecans, finely chopped
* 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips


## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and lightly grease a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan.
1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt; set aside.
1. With an electric mixer fitted with a wire whisk, whip all 4 bananas and sugar together for a good 3 minutes.
1. Add the melted butter, eggs, and vanilla; beat well and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
1. Mix in the dry ingredients just until incorporated.
1. Fold in the nuts, chocolate chips and the mashed bananas with a rubber spatula.
1. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Give the pan a good rap on the counter to get any air bubbles out.
1. Slice a banana thinly lengthwise and lay down two pieces over banana bread cut side down and press gently.  (Optional and decorative)
1. Bake for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.
1. Cool the bread in the pan for 10 minutes or so, and then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.
