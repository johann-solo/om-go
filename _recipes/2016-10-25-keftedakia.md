## Ingredients
* 1 lb. of ground meat of your choice
* 1 onion grated or tsp of powder
* 1 clove of garlic or tsp of powder
* 1/4-1/2 cup of bread crumbs (or two slices of bread soaked in water and then squeezed dry
* 1 tsp extra virgin olive oil
* 1/4 cup each of fresh mint, parsley and dill (dill is optional) chopped very finely
* 1 egg
* 1 tsp of dried oregano
* 1 tsp of olive oil
* 1 tsp each of salt and pepper
* dust lightly with flour after forming them into balls or patties (optional)

## Directions:
1. Combine all ingredients until everything is well incorporated and form into meatballs or small patties if you are grilling them.
1. Bake meatballs at 350 for approx 30 minutes or until golden and cooked through. I usually flip them once. Or you can pan fry or grill them until done.
