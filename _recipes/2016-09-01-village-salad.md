This salad is a classic and is great if you prefer less lettuce and more chunking vegetables in your salad.
<br><br>

## Ingredients

* Tomatoes chopped into chunks
* Cucumbers chopped in to chunks
* Sweet green pepper sliced
* Small red onion sliced
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Kalamata olives
* Feta cheese (optional)

Combine all ingredients and top the salad with lots of olive oil, salt and pepper and a good bit of dried oregano. Then top with some Kalamata olives and a thick slice of feta that gets broken up during serving
<br><br>

Many recipes call for a vinaigrette made of olive oil and red wine vinegar which is totally delicious. But I personally don't add the vinegar. I find the tomatoes although firm get a little macerated and the acidity from them is a good enough combo with the olive oil.
<br><br>

I didn't put measurements because it's up to you how much tomatoes and cucumber and sweet pepper you would like to add for the size of the salad your making. Season to taste as well and omit the olives and cheese according to your diet and taste.

Enjoy with crusty bread for dipping the delicious juices created by the tomato and the rich olive oil and crumbled feta.
