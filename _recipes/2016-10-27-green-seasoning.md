Yes you can get it in a bottle but as Trini's say "fresh is bess" so here's a simple recipe for your basic Trini green seasoning.
<br><br>

I like to make it fresh per meal but you can definitely make a large batch and freeze it too which I have done in the past and it's great to have on hand. I can't give you exact amounts because you can adjust amounts to taste and also to the amount you need for your meat.  
<br>

Ingredients and recipe for one single purpose seasoning. Double or triple recipe to freeze or reserve for later use:
<br>

## Ingredients
* A couple of bunches of chive or scallions/green onions
* A small bunch of chadon beni or cilantro
* A few cloves of garlic
* A small bunch of parsley
* A small bunch of Trini celery or you can sub a stalk or two of regular celery but Trini celery is more flavourful
* A small bunch of fresh thyme plus a small bunch of large leaf Spanish thyme if you have but this is optional (I don't always have this one)
* a few (2-4) pimento peppers. These are so flavourful and delicious but if you can't find any than you can sub in a sweet red bell pepper but the flavour is not quite the same.

## Directions:
* Put all ingredients in food processor and then use to marinade meat    
* Some add a little liquid like vinegar lemon/lime juice or water.  I think that would be good if you were to use a blender to grind the seasoning to a paste.  But with a food processor I don't need to add any liquids to get the seasoning chopped finely so I leave it out. I like it chopped finely and not so much a paste. So again it's all preference.
