## Ingredients
* 1/4 cup of EVOO( or less but like [lathera](http://oliveandmango.com/lathera) you don't want to really stinge out, it's the oil that adds to the richness of this dish)
* 2 small onions
* 4 cloves of garlic
* 2 sprigs of chive/ green onion sliced
* 6 pimento peppers sliced finely ( or any pepper you desire for that matter)
* One or two handfuls of finely chopped spinach or kale or 3 frozen spinach cubes (cause you know I always gotta add some greens to everything)
* 4-6 tomatoes chopped or you can use a large can of crushed or diced tomatoes
* 1 tbsp tomatoes paste
* 1/4 tsp each of dried oregano, thyme, rosemary, marjoram, sage and basil(Your basic dried Italian seasoning)
* 1/4 Tsp of chili flakes
* 5 fresh good quality eggs
* 1/2 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese
* A good handful of fresh chopped parsley to top before serving
* Another good glug for over the peppers when they are stuffed and ready to go into the oven


## Directions:
1. Heat oil in a heavy pan like a cast iron or a pan that is oven safe on medium heat
2. Sauté onion, chive and peppers until on it is soft  and translucent
3. Add in garlic and chili flakes and herbs and sauté for about a minute
4. Add in the tomatoes and paste, bring to a simmer and lower the heat slightly and let simmer for at least 10 min or so until the sauce is nice and thick and most but not all the moisture is gone
5. Drop in your eggs and let them cook to almost what you desire them to be leaving room for them to cook a little more when you transfer them to the oven.  I love mine runny but let them cook to your preference.
6. Toss in the cheese and put in the oven to broil and watch skillet carefully.  You only need to have it under the broiler for a few minutes or just enough for the cheese to melt and get a slight color.  You do not want to overcook the eggs because well, that would just be boring!
7. Sprinkle on the fresh parsley and serve with a nice hearty bread to mop up the sauce.
