## Ingredients
* 1/2 -1 full loaf of ciabatta bread or any crusty bread or baguette would work cubed
* 2 tbsp each of butter and EVOO
* 1 sprigs of thyme (or rosemary would go beautifully also)
* 1-2 cloves of garlic chopped
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
* 2 tbsp or more according to taste of balsamic vinegar or red wine vinegar

## Directions:
1.  Preheat oven at 350 degrees
2. Make your Horiatiki salad as shown in my [recipes](http://oliveandmango.com/village-salad).  Add the vinegar to the olive oil to make a vinaigrette.  Let stand.
3. Heat an oven safe pan to medium/high and put your butter and EVOO in.  Once butter is melted toss in your bread and salt and toss well so bread is well coated with oils
4. Fry it up for a couple min then add the thyme and garlic and give it a good stir then place in the oven for approx 15-20min or until golden brown and very crispy.  Check often to make sure they do not burn and toss if needed.  
5. Add them to salad along with your fresh chopped basil, toss well and serve.
