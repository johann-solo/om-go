The easiest way to have that tangy lemon flavour all year round especially when lemons are hard to come by when they are not in season.  So take advantage of when they are. Stock up and preserve. Then you can add them to your salads, soups, stews, and any dish you want to add a lemony twist to.  I preserved mine a couple of weeks ago and cant wait until mine are ready to use. I will post some more pics when they are ready.

### What you will need:

* Sterile Mason jar or jars or other tight sealing jars
* Salt
* Lemons scrubbed clean

### Directions:

1. Place a tablespoon of salt at the bottom of jar

1. Cut the ends off the lemons and quarter them but don't cut right through leaving them attached at the bottom.

1. Salt generously the inside of the quartered lemons by rubbing it in well and then place it in the jar and press it down to the bottom squeezing it down until its packed down and flattened

1. Add another tsp of salt and then continue to layer them with salt, packing them down and releasing their juices.  Finish the layering with another tsp of salt and make sure you don't over fill the jar.  You should have enough lemon juice and salt covering all the lemons from all the pressing and packing. If not just squeeze some more lemon juice on them. You can also add flavourings to it as well like bay leaf, thyme, chilies, peppercorns or anything you would like but that is optional.  

1. Seal the jar and keep in a cool dark place for approx 1 month before using.  Turn the jars daily to redistribute the salt.  

1. Once open store the jar in the fridge and re-cover with a little lemon juice or olive oil as needed after each use

1. Use only the rind chopped finely in recipes and scrape away the pith. Feel free to rinse it if you want it less salty before using.
