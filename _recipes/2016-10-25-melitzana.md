## Ingredients
* 1 whole medium sized washed eggplant and pierced with a knife or fork a few times in a couple places ( so that it doesn't explode on you)
* 2-3 tbsp of EVOO
* 1 whole green onion/ scallion sliced finely
* 1/4 cup of crumbled feta cheese
* 1-2 cloves garlic

## Directions:
1. Roast whole for 40 min to an hour depending on how large your eggplant is at 350 degrees turning once half way.  

1. Grill whole on low to medium flame for approx 15-20 minutes keeping a close eye on it and turning every few minutes.  It's ok if it gets a little charted on the outside.  

1. While it's roasting or grilling fry up your minced garlic in the olive oil for a couple of min and reserve (this is totally optional not just the frying but the garlic on the whole)

1. Once it's cooked carefully slice in half.  On each half drizzle with olive oil on its own or the garlic and olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, as well as the scallions and feta.
Serve it just like that and you can spoon servings of it right out of the eggplant or just eat the whole half yourself like i do.  You can eat it any which way but I love it with a side of pita bread to dip into or spread it on.
