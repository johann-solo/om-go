* 4 tablespoons sugar
* 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, melted
* 12 bite-size peanut butter cups

### For the filling
* 2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature
* 1 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract or almond extract

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

1. Place a paper cupcake liner in each cup of a standard muffin pan.

1. **To make crust:** In a bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar and melted butter until crumbs are moistened. Press crust into bottom of each muffin cup. Put 1 peanut butter cup into the center of each crust.

1. **To make the filling:** Beat cream cheese with a handheld electric mixer until fluffy. Add sugar, flour, and vanilla, beating well. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Spoon cream cheese mixture over peanut butter cups and graham cracker crusts. Bake until just set, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool completely before serving.
