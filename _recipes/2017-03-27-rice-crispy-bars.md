These little guys are such a treat! And they are practically guilt free with no refined sugar, gluten free  and can be completely plant based if you omit the chocolate chips or use vegan ones.
They are highly addictive and really satiate any sweet cravings!! I adapted the recipe from [@erinireland](https://www.instagram.com/erinireland) (who is one of my favs). Hope you enjoy my little additions!

### Directions

1. Line a square pan or a loaf pan with parchment paper and set aside

1. In a large bowl whisk together the peanut butter and coconut oil, vanilla extract and maple syrup, and salt until well combined

1. Stir in the shredded coconut, and chocolate chips and then the rice puffs. Stir until the rice puffs are fully coated.

1. Pour out into the pan and using your spatula to smooth out the mixture pressing it down gently and evenly.

1. Refrigerate or freeze while you prepare the glaze allowing it to set.

1. In two separate small bowls combine all the ingredients for each glaze separately until
smooth and pourable

1. Remove the squares from the fridge and pour one of the glazes on top of it first spreading it over and then pour the second one over and spread and also use a fork to swirl the two glazes together. If you want to do just one flavour of glaze just double the recipe.

1. Top with chopped nuts and refrigerate until the glaze is fully set then cut the squares and enjoy!
