* 1/4 cup parsley chopped finely
* 3 tbsp dill chopped finely

1. Stir and sauté the rice until it turns golden.
1. Add the wine and let it evaporate.
1. Add in all your herbs, S&P, and spinach and give it a good stir (do this for a few min if using frozen spinach to allow it to start to break down)
1. Then, add the water/broth
1. Lower heat to medium and cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring every few minutes so that it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pot. (Feel free to add a little extra if it needs to cook further)
