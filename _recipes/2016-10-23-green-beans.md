## Ingredients
* 3/4-1 lb. of green beans washed and trimmed
* 1 tbsp honey or maple syrup(I have found that maple syrup doesn't thicken as much as honey, so if the mix is still runny at the end feel free to add a small amount of a corn starch slurry)
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp butter
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1/4-1/2 tsp each Salt and pepper to taste ( watch the salt because the soy is salty)
* 1 tbsp minced garlic
* 1/4 tsp of chilli flakes (optional if you want some heat)
* 1/4 tsp sesame oil (option)

## Directions:
1. Combine soy sauce, honey and tbsp of water in a small dish and set aside
2. Heat butter and olive oil in a sauce pan at medium- high heat.
3.  Once butter is melted add chilli flakes(if you are using) the green beans and salt and pepper tossing the beans to totally coat. Cook them for approximately 10 min until they are nice and browned and withered, shrunken and tender. They will be nice and brown and so will the butter/oil mixture in the pan
4. Reduce heat, add garlic and saut√© for about 30 seconds
5. Add the soy mixture and stir beans well and continue stirring until liquid thickens into a glaze, add the sesame oil and then plate, serve and enjoy
