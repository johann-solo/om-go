excerpt: <p>A delicious twist to the classic flavours of baklava without the phyllo</p>
---

I love baklava! Who doesn’t though &ndash; probably those of you with bad nut allergies but you know what I mean. What if I told you you could have the flavours of baklava in a fabulous dessert without as much effort and no phyllo involved? Plus any leftovers can double as breakfast the next day! A sweet deal I would say. This is the situation here with these parfaits.

Really simple dessert and also pretty quick  to put together as well. Not only that it can totally be veganised. The alternatives to making it vegan are listed next to the ingredients. Maple syrup instead of honey is fabulous but I do prefer the honey. Especially our local honey which is super fragrant with floral notes and fabulous.

I like to make a double batch of the granola cause I love lots of leftovers that can be eaten for breakfast over yoghurt with honey (a classic in the olive and mango home) or of course with some almond milk. I would love to say there are leftover apples but usually I end up eating those out of the pan and they are gone with just enough for assembling the parfaits. What? I can’t help myself! Butter and honey apples &ndash; can’t resist &ndash; won’t resist &ndash; zero resistance &ndash; piece de resistance? The end!

Basically you just gotta make these!! Did I mention they are also a great make&ndash;ahead dessert perfect for having people over. You can make and store the granola in an airtight container for a couple days. You can also make the apples a day ahead and keep them refrigerated in an airtight container (sealed very tight cause I may find them) until you are ready to assemble. The only thing you would have to do when serving is make the whip which literally takes minutes and assembly is pretty easy and fuss free! Give them a try if you’re looking for a little something different and a little reminiscent of a Greek/Middle Eastern/Turkish classic. Hope that covered all my baklava making countries. Each component is delicious and together they are a symphony of yum! And do not go easy on the honey &ndash; let it flow!

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 300 &deg; F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper

1. Toss all the baklava granola ingredients together in a large bowl and then transfer to the baking sheet and bake for approx 30 minutes or until golden and crisp, checking and shaking pan around a little to toss halfway through baking time. Once done remove and place pan on cooling rack until completely cool and while you prepare the rest of the layers

1. In a large skillet over medium heat melt the butter and add the apples and cinnamon and cook stirring frequently for approx 10-15 minutes or until apples are tender. Add the honey, vanilla and orange blossom water and stir the apples well to coat. Cook for another couple of minutes and then take them off the heat and set aside

1. In a large bowl whip/beat with a mixer the heavy cream along with the vanilla and orange blossom water until it turns into soft peeks and then set aside

1. To build each parfait layer according to preference. I usually do 2 tbsp apples on bottom followed by 2 tbsp of granola and then 2 tbsp whip and repeat. I end it off with a little extra sprinkle of granola and crushed nuts and a good little drizzle of honey.
