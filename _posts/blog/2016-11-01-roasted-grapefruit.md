excerpt: <p>Why not add a twist to your citrus the next time you need some natural Vitamin C</p>

---

I have been feeling really run down the last few days.  I hear something is going around and it must be true because friends, workmates, and patients alike have been sick with some sort of flu bug.  I have been downing all my chicken and rice soup. I'm a big believer in vitamin C and echinacea too, but if I can have the real deal I will do that too. That's why I thought it would be perfect to roast some grapefruit and oranges that I still had around from the market just the other day.

Grapefruits are so intense in flavour and I love them fresh or roasted. Roasting them just deepens the flavour and gives them a certain bitter-sweet smokiness.

Everyone knows grapefruits are great weight loss inducers because they charge up your metabolism and they are also full of vitamin C which makes them great for your immune system but did you know they can help reduce free radicals and even help with gum disease due to their vitamin C content?

Grapefruit increases blood levels of vitamin C, which promotes healing, and also lessens damage caused by free radical molecules. This helps in repairing gum tissue.  Just a quick reminder though, moderation is key because they are also acidic and can have a damaging effect on you tooth enamel, so like any other acidic food do not brush your teeth right after having them.  Wait at least 20-30 minutes.  It's also a liver cleanser, and helpful in preventing kidney stones. It's so great when something that tastes so good is also so good for you!!

As I mentioned before, I love to eat them fresh just on their own or with a dash or two of bitters on them.   When I roast them though, I love to throw on some brown or coconut sugar and cinnamon. Yum!! So delicious.  
<br>

What to do with them when you have roasted them? Well there's many options.  They are great on their own.  Just grab a spoon and dig in.  But they would be delicious  mixed into a salad.  They would be great as a salsa on grilled chicken or fish. They would be fabulous in a cocktail or margarita.  I think they would be great on a bed of yoghurt and drizzled with some honey and sprinkled with more cinnamon.  
<br>

Today I added them over stove-top coconut oats and chia with a caramelised banana too. Talk about a good breakfast!!  You can definitely use overnight oats as well.  I forgot to soak my oats so I just did them on the stove top today. If you don't think you would like that combo of the tart and sweet you can eat them on the side. But it's a nice blend with the coconut oats. Here are the recipes (this made enough for two bowls/people)

## Coconut chia oats soaked or stove top

### Ingredients
* 1 cup of old fashion rolled oats
* 1/4 cup chia
* 1 cup of almond milk
* 1/2 cup of coconut milk or more to get the consistency you prefer (if you're using powder than 2tbsp should be enough with 1/2 a cup of liquid either more almond milk, a different dairy, or just water)
* 1-2 tbsp of maple syrup to sweeten but that is optional. I don't usually add any.

### Directions:
* Place all ingredients in a small pot and cook at med/high until your desired consistency and oats are nice and soft.  It usually takes 5-10 min maximum.  If you are soaking them place all ingredients in a sealable bowl or jar, mix well and seal and store in fridge overnight

## Roasted grapefruit

### Ingredients
* 1-2 grapefruits
* 1-2 tbsp coconut sugar or brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp of cinnamon
* 1-2 tbsp of maple syrup (optional)

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees
1. Cut grapefruits in half. Cut a thin slice off the bottom of them so they sit better and don't wobble on your baking sheet.  Use a pairing knife to cut around separating pith and flesh and cut down each segment too to make things easier after they are baked.  
1. Sprinkle on your sugar and cinnamon
1. Roast on a baking sheet for 20 to 30 minutes or until golden brown
1. When they are done drizzle with maple syrup (optional) and serve any way you like

## Caramelised bananas

### Ingredients
* 1-2 bananas sliced down the middle and then halved
* 1-2 tbsp of coconut oil
* 1-2 tbsp of coconut sugar or brown sugar

## Directions:
1. heat oil and sugar in pan on med/high until sugar starts to melt
1. Add the bananas and saut√© each side for 2-3 minutes

Once everything is ready plate your oats, place banana over the oats along with a few segments of grapefruit ( or serve the whole roasted grapefruit on the side) some Coconut flakes and then drizzle with any left over syrup from the caramelised bananas or maple syrup or both. I don't judge!! Enjoy!!
