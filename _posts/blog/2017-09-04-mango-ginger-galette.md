  <p>The perfect and most delicious way to use up all your ripe and half ripe
  mangoes</p> 
---

It's been mango madness over here because both me and my husband love mangoes and we are now at the tail end of mango season.  We are super fortunate to have family with a mango tree so when it's the season there is an abundance. I love to eat them just as they are and I also like to add them to my oats or over yoghurt. When I have a lot of ripe ones at one given time I remove all the pulp from them and freeze them and add them to smoothies.

This time I wanted to try something a little different. I thought I would try my hand at a galette.  I'm not very confident with anything dough-like but I saw a good recipe from Eat delicious and I thought I would try it.  I wanted to sort of make it my own though, so I just followed some basic principles from Dennis Prescott's recipe and used my own flavours.

The ginger in the recipe is not at all overpowering and goes well with the mangoes giving them a little extra flavour boost.  The dough comes together very quickly in the food processor and grating the butter makes all the difference even though you are using the food processor. I do it all the time with my scones and also my puff pastry which I will share in the near future.

The original recipe called for vodka and I wanted to know why. I'm not opposed to adding booze to anything but I wanted to know if there was actually a chemical reaction of sorts that takes place by adding it so I did a little research.  I learned that there is some science to back up making a boozy galette or pie crust. The alcohol (has to be a hard liquor like vodka, bourbon or Rum) isn't necessarily to intoxicate the pie but  has to do with the gluten.

Liquid is needed for the dough to form into a ball. When liquids are added to the wheat flours, the wheat flour proteins form gluten which can really toughen up the dough. To help prevent this but still allow the fat and flour to bind and make that little dough ball, you add the booze. In their cookbook, The Science of Good Cooking, Cook’s Illustrated explains “...gluten won’t form in alcohol. The ethyl alcohol in vodka and other liquors does not attach itself in the same way as water. Because of this, it does not hydrate the proteins, and therefore does not aid in gluten formation.”

So there you have it, there's a good reason to add booze to your dough! For those who are worried about the alcohol instilling too much flavour into the crust - have no fear, you barely notice it's there. If you still have your concerns than stick to adding the vodka which almost leaves little to no trace after it's been baked.

This recipe is fabulously easy and that is saying a lot coming from me! I'm going to try making more pies and pastries in the near future and I will continue to chose the easiest ways of making them to share with you guys! This is a great no fail recipe for the crust and I will be using it with other fillings too. Definitely give it a go and let me know what you think of it!

### Directions

1. Combine the flour, sugar, lime zest and salt in a food processor and pulse several times to combine. Remove the butter from freezer and peel back half the wrapper form the butter and use the wrapped part as a grip which makes it easier to hold the butter while you grate it. Grate the whole stick of butter on a box grater using the large wholes. Try to do this as quickly as possible so that it stays cold and crumbly. Once it's grated add it to the food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.

1. With the processor running on low, add 1 tbsp of Rum at a time until the mixture comes together into a ball. Turn it out onto a a lightly floured surface and shape it into a flattened disc with your hands. Cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 3 hours or overnight.  

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F when ready to make the filling, and line a baking sheet with parchment paper

1. In a large bowl combine all the filling Ingredients and gently stir to combine.

1. Sprinkle flour on a your rolling surface along with your rolling pin and get the disc dough out of the fridge and roll it out into approx 12 inch round.  Once you have it rolled out transfer it onto the baking dish by rolling it onto the the rolling pin and then rolling it off the pin and on to the baking sheet for a
smoother transition.

1. Starting with the ripest mangos, spoon them out into the middle of the dough and the more firm pieces you can arrange on top, and spread out leaving 1&frac12; inch border all around.

1. Fold the edges of the dough as if you are pleating it as you work your way around the whole galette which will hold all that lovely filling in.  

1. Whisk the egg and brush the top of the dough with it and then sprinkle the dough generously with the brown sugar

1. Bake for approx 45-50 minutes or until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden brown. It's totally ok if juice from the filling seeps out a bit onto the parchment paper while it's baking. Serve warm topped with ice cream or whipped cream or enjoy it on its own.
