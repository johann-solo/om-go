excerpt: <p>Make the perfect guacamole dip the way you like it</p>
---

The one snack I never tire of is chips and dip.  Crispy salty chips that are really a mode to getting more of that dip in your mouth. My favourite combo is tortilla chips and guacamole. I could make this creamy delicious dip any day of the year back home having avocados available all year round, so you understand why I treasure each one of them here and crave guacamole so badly.  The avocados we have here are absolutely delicious and huge. Are they perfect for guacamole? Not really but they still make a yummy one and I will take what I can get.  Ours are a little on the sweeter side and they have a higher water content.  I love them nevertheless and I will always work with what I have available.

Ideally the Hass variety of avocados are the best for making a nice guacamole. They have to be nice and ripe – so dark colour skin and soft to the touch.  And the key to a great guacamole in my opinion is that you need the freshest ingredients. I don’t want to say ‘in my opinion’ throughout the whole post so when I state something about guacamole preference, it’s just that – my preference and my opinion.  I’m not the authority on guac or its authenticity. I’m just sharing how I love it.

Fresh ingredients are a must, and lots of lime to add lots of flavour to keep your beautiful dip from turning brown.  If you’re making it ahead and worried about oxidation, lots of lime is the solution, as well as storing it in an airtight container with a few of the pits or seeds of the avo smushed in the dip. (Make sure to remove them before serving though) Another tip I have heard of but not tried is adding a &frac12; inch layer of water over the dip while it’s sitting in the fridge in a sealed container and then tipping the water out and stirring the guac before serving. The thin layer of water acts as a barrier to prevent oxidation.  Whenever I make it, it’s gone way before that happens so I don’t usually worry about that.

### To add in or not to add in
The recipe below is how I make it always.  I don’t add sour cream or mayo or any thing like that.  I actually don’t even add tomatoes which many people love to add to it. Just my choice. I find they get a little soggy and I dislike the texture of them in it.  If you don’t mind the texture of them in your guacamole then they are definitely a great add in.  A few other things I add sometimes are a clove of garlic grated, chopped green onions or chives and extra peppers for more heat and flavour.  If I’m organized and plan ahead I even like to roast my garlic and jalapeños which adds a smoky and fabulous flavour to the guacamole. Cilantro or Chadon Beni is a must! That’s one ingredient I insist on – without it, it just ain’t guac!

### Let’s talk about texture
Texture is completely all preference. Some like it super smooth and done in a food processor but I personally like it creamy but still chunky so I do the smashing with a fork which allows you to control how smooth or chunky you want it. There you have it! Grab some avocados and make some of this glorious dip and enjoy it snacking on the couch and catching up on your Netflix, or if you’re like me while finishing up work in front of my computer. Either way enjoy!!

### Ingredients

* 2-4 of our local avocados or approx 5 ripe haas variety avocados
* Juice of two limes
* &frac12; of a red onion chopped chopped finely
* &frac34; cup loosely packed cilantro, Chadon Beni chopped finely
* 1-2 jalapeños seeds removed and chopped finely
* Salt to taste  
(For more add-ins check the post above)

### Directions

1. Cut each avocado open, remove pit (save pit if making a head and storing in guac) scoop out the avocado into a bowl and squeeze juice from one of the limes all over the avocados and this will help prevent browning. Use a fork to mash them into the consistency you like.

1. Stir in gently the the onions, jalapeños and cilantro.

1. Squeeze in the juice of the second lime and season well with salt to taste - stirring guac gently to combine.

1. Serve with your fav tortilla chips, or with tacos, burritos or literally slathered onto anything and enjoy!!
