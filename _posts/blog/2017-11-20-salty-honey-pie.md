excerpt: <p>You will be dreaming of this creamy custard pie after just one bite</p>
---
Only the best pie to ever touch my lips. I had heard about the Four &amp; Twenty Blackbirds Pie Book and their pie shop in Brooklyn from some foodie friends, and naturally when we were in NYC last month I needed to try a piece of pie from them to see what the hype was really all about. It definitely lived up to the hype. I am not a pie person per say. Pie isn’t going to be my first choice for dessert. That being said though, its not my least favourite either. One of my favourites of course before this one, is warm apple pie with vanilla ice cream. What can I say &ndash; I’m pretty basic.

I definitely am not a lover of pumpkin pie either so I had my doubts about this custard pie that was served to me by accident.  I had ordered the salted caramel apple pie and I think the girl must have heard salted and then full stop. Well I’m glad she did cause if I had a choice I would choose this one every time. Although in their defence, I’m sure if I tried any of their pies I would feel the same way about all of them.

The crust was everything you want a crust to be, buttery with the right amount of flakiness and density to hold up that custard. And that custard is absolutely fabulous.  Creamy, with just the right amount of sweetness. Every bite feels kind of sinful. Topping it with whip and a sprinkle of salt really offsets and balances the sweetness.  Honey gives this pie a beautiful flavour and a different kind of sweetness. Our local raw honey is fragrant and almost floral and went perfectly with this pie. I’m sure if you use a raw flavoured honey you could change up the taste of the pie itself. Joy the baker used a sage one so I can only imagine how that tasted. Not that it needs it but it’s worth experimenting with.

I used her version of the pie crust because it’s one of the easiest ones i have seen out there and it’s a tasty one too. I loved the outcome of it and have used it as a base for other pies and love it.  I especially love the simplicity of it.  It rolled out perfectly also and freezes well too. I will be testing it out with cutouts this weekend and I’m sure it will be wonderful!

This pie was truly unforgettable for me and I’m so glad I could replicate it. It tasted as close as I remembered it tasting having my first bite seated at one of the rustic long tables at the pie shop in Brooklyn. If you’re a pie lover or not this is definitely one to try. I won’t promise conversion but I do promise a very enjoyable tasting bite after bite that is worth the effort that comes in making this pie.

### Directions

**For the crust**
1. In a large bowl whisk together the flour, sugar and salt and then add the grated butter and work it into the flour mixture with your fingers. Create a well in the middle of it and pour in the buttermilk.  Use a fork to bring the dough together and try to moisten all the flour bits. You want the mixture to be quite shaggy and not wet but do add a little more buttermilk to bring it together if needed.

1. Dump the mixture onto a floured surfaced. Gently knead into a flat disk, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour at least or overnight like I usually do.
Roll out the dough on a well floured surface until It is about 12 inches in diameter and then transfer it to the pie pan. Trim the edges so that they are pretty much even with the pie pan and then fold the edges under and crimp them using your fingers. Cover it with plastic wrap and store in the fridge while you prep the filling

1. Preheat oven to 375 &deg; F
<br>

**For the filling**
1. In a medium bowl whisk together the melted butter, sugar, cornmeal, salt and vanilla extract until combined. Then add the honey whisking it well to fully incorporate it. Then add the eggs one at a time whisking thoroughly to combine.

1. Whisk in the heavy cream and vinegar.

1. Take the crust out of the fridge and lightly brush the edges of the pie crust with egg wash.  Then pour the filling into the crust and bake for 45-55 minutes until pie is a deep golden brown and puffed around the edges and set in the centre.

1. Once done remove it from the oven and allow it to rest for 4 hours before serving.

1. Serve with a dollop of whip and a sprinkle of salt and enjoy
