I have always loved the combination of pork chops and apples so its only natural to pair apples with sausages! This is a great way to use up any apples that might be a little on the sad side - you know the ones. The ones you took to work planning to eat but came back home with you, are a little bruised and on the soft but you feel too guilty to throw out.  Those bruised softies are perfect for this meal. They cook down to being nice and fork tender with a nice browned edge. Just mouthwatering!

I like getting a piece of everything in each bite when I eat this dish so you get a bit of sweet and savoury in each bite. I slice my sausage and apples and get a bit of each and some greens in each and every blissful bite! Don’t even get me started on the pan juices! All the flavours; sweet, savoury and fragrant are all captured in it and you must sweep them up off the plate with each bite.

It’s a wonderful midweek meal that is done in under thirty minutes.  It can be a stand alone meal or you can pair it with a grain like some buttery rice or quinoa or some roasted potatoes would be wonderful as well. Its kind of a crowd pleaser too both in taste and visually so it’s also great for a diner party. The fact that its quick and easy makes it even more appealing for stress free entertaining. You can switch up the sausage in it as well.  You can have it with any other sausage even a vegan sausage if you prefer. We wanted to use the spicy Italian because it has a mild kick that adds another dimension of flavour.  I’m sure whichever route you go you will love this simple and delicious dish! Enjoy!!
