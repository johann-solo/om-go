excerpt: Tender saucy shrimp and noodles. The perfect midweek meal which comes together quickly and will satisfy the whole family!
---

I'm going to keep this one brief guys.  At least about the recipe itself. It's a great recipe that has a good little kick of heat in it and includes a good amount of veggies.  It's totally satisfying and the sauce is absolutely 'lick the bowl clean' good.  
<br>

Both my husband and I love soba noodles and this right here is one of our favourite combos. The shrimp is not only tender and dripping of that delicious sauce but it also cooks up really fast meaning this dish comes together really quickly making it perfect for a midweek meal.

I mentioned already about that kick of heat. To make it kid friendly or wimp friendly (joking!!!) either reduce the Sriracha and chili flakes or omit altogether.  It will still be packed with flavour but without the heat.

I enjoyed shooting this a lot. Putting together food or smoothie bowls is probably my favourite thing to cook/make, plate, decorate and shoot. The smoothie bowls are trickier because of the chronic heat in this country but I still have fun making them.

Here's a few things I have learned from others and along the way by trial and error when photographing these kinds of bowls. The meat always needs to look moist, veggies need to look fresh and crunchy, noodles need to look wet and appetising not dry, and garnishes and herbs need to look fresh as well.  Good lighting also goes a long way too.  I wash my veggies and herbs and then spin them dry in my salad spinner and keep them cool right up to when I plate.
<br>
<br>

Plate your noodles and don't overfill your bowl with them. Then build around your noodles. I put the shrimp on the noodles but I don't baste them with sauce until right before I take my shot and I keep basting them right through the shoot.  I always have a brush and small bowl with a bit of olive oil in it close by when I'm shooting  and I brush what needs to be brushed to keep it looking moist. So I brushed oil on the noodles so they don't look dry and I mist my veggies if needed or baste them with oil or water to keep them from looking dry as well.

Meat is sometimes the hardest thing to photograph but keeping the whole basting thing in mind when shooting meat is critical to making it look appetising. Those are just some very basic little tricks of the trade to making your food look fabulous when you post it on Instagram or on your blog. Little touches like this really make a difference though.  I'm still learning lots and getting a lot of help from other bloggers who inspire me to take better shots, style my food more appealingly and  sometimes come out of my comfort zone when it comes to styling.

A good camera obviously helps but you don't need one to get decent shots. There are tons of bloggers out there that use their cellphones to shoot.  Just try to get clear shots in good lighting and try to make your food look as appealing as possible.

I loved sharing these simple little tips and will share more as I remember and as I learn more.  Hope you enjoyed them and hope they helped.  If you have any to share I would love to hear about them in your comments!!
