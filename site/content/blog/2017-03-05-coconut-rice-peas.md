excerpt: "<p>The Caribbean's favourite 'anytime' side dish</p>"

This is a basic rice and peas recipe and it's one that I often make and switch up a lot.  I love to add different beans to it or even green peas and carrots as well.  I also add pumpkin and spinach or bhaji to it too.  I like to also add different flavourings to it by adding pimento peppers and thyme. This recipe is a basic rice and peas but feel free to play around with the variations.

The method is really what makes this rice a little more unique and makes it very flavourful. It gets finished off in the oven as opposed to the stovetop.  I can always tell wether rice has been cooked stove top or baked. It's a little nuttier tasting, more evenly cooked and I always find it's more flavourful too. I think that I am accustomed to it being baked because my mom always baked her rice.  Greek rice always tastes the best when it's baked, at least I think so. I had this style rice at Kariwak Village hotel in Tobago and I could tell right away that it was baked. It was so tasty and so creamy and buttery and had a hint of coconut. I absolutely loved it and tested many versions of this type of rice until I got it to taste as similar as I remember.

I have had all sorts of rice and peas or peas and rice whether it's Trini style, Jamaican style or whatever style and by far I prefer this one.  It's simple and so flavourful and it works beautifully with white rice, brown rice and I have even used jasmine rice with it.  I find the only difference is that some rice will turnout a little stickier than others as demonstrated by the rice in this shot (ends up more like a pilaf).  Regardless of what you use, the flavour outcome is consistent.

Another thing I have  been doing is soaking my rice for 8-12 hours so basically overnight in water and yoghurt ( 1 cup = 1 tbsp of plain yoghurt).  This soaking or fermenting of the rice is suppose to remove an acid called phytic acid which is in grains that can make them hard to digest.  So soaking the rice helps with digesting and absorption of the nutrients from the grains.  After soaking you just rinse them well and use the grain as you would otherwise.  I got this info fro my friend Pamela from [@carmlapilates](https://www.instagram.com/carmelapilates/). Definitely do your own research about this and do what's best for you.
