excerpt: Need a change from your regular scalloped potatoes?

I'm sitting here writing this post while I rewatch old seasons of the Gilmore girls. How did I not watch every single episode before?!?! I have a new found appreciation for this show and have been binge watching it in the background while I cook and clean before I start watching the new ones.

I'm just waiting for these delicious scalloped sweet potatoes to come out of the oven, and cannot wait to dig into them.  They are creamy and delicious and not full of heavy cream and cheese.  Although they have milk and cheese in them,  it's not overwhelming or too rich and a little lighter in calories. I made them with a herbed béchamel sauce.

I don't know what's better than a creamy rich and perfect béchamel sauce.  It definitely adds something special to every dish. When I was a kid I would savour every bite of the béchamel off the top of pastitsio or moussaka when my mom would make it for dinner. I would scrape it off the top and put it aside and eat everything else (sometimes I wouldn't and only would eat what I scraped off) and save it for the end. That way it would be the last thing I tasted.  Mmmm!! Now I just devour everything and have more of an appreciation for the eggplant in that moussaka.

The one thing that could make this dish easier to make is a mandoline which I don't presently own as yet.  A good sharp knife does the trick too though, just takes a little more time and patience.  It's worth it though.  These are so creamy and good. (How many times have I said creamy?)  I love the sweetness of the potatoes and the sage and thyme in the sauce really complement it well.  If it's too much sweetness for you though, feel free to go half and half with regular yellow or white potatoes.   I mean the potatoes are really just there as an excuse to eat more creamy goodness and béchamel right?!?
Whatever you use you will enjoy these CREAMY scalloped sweet potatoes.  I assure you!!

## Scalloped sweet potatoes
<br>

### Ingredients:

* 4 medium sized sweet potatoes peeled and sliced as thin as possible (more depending on the size of the dish)
* 1 onion chopped very finely
* 2 cloves of garlic chopped finely
* 4 cups of milk warmed or at least room temperature (add a little extra milk, water or stock to thin out the sauce if needed
* 4 tbsp of flour
* 1 tsp of thyme
* 1/4 tsp of sage
* 2 tbsp of butter
* 2 tbsp of EVOO
* 1 cup of grated cheese (I used white sharp cheddar but you could vary what cheese you would like to use)
<br>


### Directions:

1. Grease a 5x8 baking dish (I use a shallow one because potatoes cook more evenly than in a deep dish)
1. Slice all potatoes and put aside and cover with water until ready to use
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees while you make your sauce
1. Heat up oil and butter in a medium sauce pan at medium heat
1. Once melted add the onions, garlic, and herbs and let everything sauté for a few minutes until the onions are soft and translucent
1. Add the flour and whisk it around so it doesn't burn for a few minutes (flour needs to cook-your making a roux)
1. Add in the milk slowly while whisking continuously. Once you have added all the milk patiently whisk( so that milk doesn't burn, and so all clumps of flour are out) until the sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon. This usually takes 5 min to up to 10.  So just be patient and keep heat at medium.  
1. Once ready take off heat and season with salt and pepper.  Make sure to over season a little  because if you don't the potatoes will be bland.  
1. Drain water from potatoes and line the dish with a layer of half the potatoes, pour out half of the sauce evenly over potatoes and sprinkle 1/4 cup of cheese over them
1. Line the rest of the potatoes evenly over cheese, pour over the rest of the sauce and sprinkle with the rest of the cheese.  
1. Bake on baking sheet covered for 25-30 minutes, uncover and bake for another 25-30 minutes (if you want to brown the top a little more just broil for a couple of minutes at the end). Once done remove from oven and let cool for ten minutes before serving.  It will set a little and make serving a little easier. Serve and enjoy!
