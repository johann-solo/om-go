excerpt: <p>Looking for a DEET-free alternative mosquito repellent? Try these unexpected methods</p>
---

So after a couple of years of worrying about Chikungunya (CHIKV) and the ever present threat of dengue we now have another one to worry about Zika virus (ZIKV)! And it's rainy season so you know those pesky mosquitos are out there on a mission to suck some serious blood.  
<br>

They love to feast on me. I'm a beacon for them and I'm still considered foreign blood to them, so I guess they enjoy having Greek food. Who could blame them right?!?!
<br><br>

All jokes aside because neither of those viruses are a laughing matter. Symptoms varying in severity from mild rash and fever to severe debilitating joint pain that can linger up to years after. Zika presents further health risks to pregnant woman and their foetuses. They are at risk of having microcephaly.  Zika can also be transmitted through sexual intercourse and worst yet one scary statistic stated that 80% of people have it without any presentable or obvious symptoms. Those trying to get pregnant beware and consult your doctor before trying.
<br><br>

Of course the risk is predominately in South America and the Caribbean.  Very few cases in North America have been reported. But for those living in high risk areas and traveling to these areas, it can be a scary thing.   
<br>

What to do? Well the usual: Wear light coloured clothing, go easy on the perfumes, use citronella oil spray and candles, spray endless amounts of Off while you hold your breath, lather on Odomos, light up and burn mosquito coils and hold your breath too!
<br>

> I have noticed that in recent years I have become more and more sensitive and reactive to chemicals

Just so I'm clear I don't criticise the use of any of those methods but I have noticed that in recent years I have become more and more sensitive and reactive to chemicals. It may have to do with years of been exposed to many cleaning chemicals in the dental office setting. So when I can, I choose a more natural approach or at least one that is DEET free. Don't get me wrong I have two spray cans of Off at home, one in the car, and a mini in my bag especially If I'm out in the "wild" or in "bushy" areas, also one in my beach bag for those pesky sand flies.
<br><br>

But for day to day use I have two really good options that have worked for me personally.  I'm speaking purely from personal experience but I got the ideas from several other campers who have felt these options worked for them too. So feel free to try them because they may work for you too.  
I know there are a lot of more "natural" options out there but here are the two I have tried and tested and have really worked for me.
<br><br>

1. SSS body oil from Avon.
1. Apple cider vinegar
<br>

The oil is pretty easy to find in Trinidad because a lot of people sell Avon here which I didn't realise at first, but a true fact so I always have some on hand. And it's even available at some local pharmacies too. After my shower I put some all over and reapply if I'm going out in the evening. I avoid putting it on if I know I'm going to be exposed to the hot sun cause it's an oil after all and you will bake with no sunscreen over it. I find that the oil and sunscreen over it is a lot to bear in our hot climate but if you feel that it won't be too heavy for you then by all means try it.
<br><br>

Its not a very strong smelling oil. It's soft smelling and many find it pleasant. Its also light enough to wear it with your favourite perfume over it. I personally am not a fan of how it smells.  I find it smells like stale strong perfume I can picture finding in my grandmothers medicine cabinet. My opinion.  Despite the smell it works really well for me especially in the evenings. I really don't know what it is about it, but the smell or something in it detracts mosquitos. Now I can't say that I haven't been bitten while wearing it but not nearly as many bites as I would without having it on.
<br><br>

In its defence even Off claims 8-10 hours of effectiveness but I still have had bites while having that on too so I believe on me, nothing is completely fool proof. I'm not claiming that SSS body oil is chemical free either because it's a perfumed body oil after all, but it is a good DEET free option and it has a moisturising effect as a good bonus!
<br><br>

Now for the apple cider vinegar. I love apple cider vinegar and am believer in its health benefits which are a very long list. Claimed benefits range from help with acid reflux, used as skin toner, weight loss and the list goes on. But I also found that having a tablespoon or two a day in your water or taken as a shot helps keep those mosquitos at bay. I heard that it's an old army trick to keep mosquitos from biting the soldiers sitting in wet and damp trenches for hours. Something about it in your system makes us repulsive to mosquitos. Whatever it is I have found it greatly reduces the bites I get, so bottoms up!!!
<br><br>
I hope these are two simple additional ways to you help avoid being a beacon attracting mosquitos. Are there any natural or DEET-free solutions that work for you?
