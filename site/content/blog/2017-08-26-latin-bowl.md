excerpt: Fabulous Latin American flavours that with keep you full and satisfied and
  counting gains
---

This is by far my favourite of the four recipes I did in collaboration with the @trainingpad! Don't get me wrong I loved them all but I have a special sort of love for Latin flavours and this meal really delivers in that department. Those flavours (plural cause Latin flavours include many) are probably on my list of top three fav flavours ever and can't get enough. If you are the same make sure to make a double batch of each recipe because you will love each component. If not-  what is wrong with you? Joking- but this meal may make you a convert!

It does takes a little time to prep everything but each component is pretty basic.  I had the rice going and oven preheating while I chopped and prepped for the beans and the peppers, onions and salsa.  I'm a multi-tasker by nature and it comes almost instinctively but even if you are not, I promise it's all doable and you will be happy you made everything.  All the recipes take under 30 minutes to cook.

Another great thing about these recipes is that they are all vegetarian and vegan.  More and more people are refraining from meat these days for health and moral reasons and this is a great option if you are too. They pack plenty of protein and nutrients from the black beans to the salsa. They are also filling and absolutely fabulous and you will not miss the meat at all.
