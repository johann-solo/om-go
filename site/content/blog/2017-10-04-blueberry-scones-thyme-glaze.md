excerpt: This pairing of blueberry and thyme will make you wonder why you made scones any other way

It’s a great feeling when you finally get a recipe just the way you want it.  That is how I felt about these scones. I have tried so many recipes and they have all been good but just not great. The great thing about trying so many types of scones and recipes for scones over the years is that you get to know and learn the basics when it comes to the techniques involved.

Let me share some very basics I have learned over the years.  Everything must be freezing cold, from the butter to the bowl and even your dry ingredients. When not using, once you have prepped the ingredients, store them in the fridge until you need them. Also do not work the dough too much. It’s not suppose to be smooth and elastic.  It’s suppose to be a bit shaggy. The more the dough is worked the more dense the scones will be, and that’s not usually a good thing with scones. You want a light crispy exterior with a fluffy’ish interior &ndash; at least thats what I want.

If you’re using frozen fruits in them, always dust them with flour before adding them to the dough and never thaw them &ndash; like never!! Keep them frozen right up until you’re suppose to add them to the dough, toss them in flour until well coated and then add them.

I like to use the fattiest Ingredients in my scones. The milk and yoghurt or sour cream should not be skim or low-fat and it’s a good idea to use a good quality butter as well. I personally don’t think any baked goods/desserts should be low fat, or low anything.  Your not suppose to eat 10 in one shot or all of them so just chill enjoy ONE (or maybe two) &ndash; a delicious one with full fat ingredients and all will be ok trust me! (Pls ignore this if you have actual dietary issues or allergies)

I really like the fold and tuck method in this recipe. I think it’s great for keeping the scones fluffy and less dense as well. I have always grated my butter from frozen.  It’s a tip I picked up a while ago in a recipe I had made (can’t remember whose) and it has just stuck. I freeze it for a half hour or so before using. This is the perfect way to incorporate it into the flour.  It’s no fuss and no need to use a pastry blender, two butter knives, a food processor or anything you would normally use to cut the butter into the flour! Hope these little basic tips help you make your scones even more delicious. I would love to hear any tips you may have so please share in the comments!

The glaze was influenced by searching what flavours go well with which fruits, and blueberries definitely go well with thyme.  The scone recipe is adapted by America’s Test Kitchen along with a few other past recipes. And the thyme glaze is adapted from Bake from Scratch. We loved the glaze and the two are a match made in heaven! Hope you think so too!

### Ingredients

* 8 tbsp of butter frozen solid and then grated and left in the freezer until ready to use plus 2 extra tbsp to melt and brush over scones before baking
* 1&frac12; cups fresh or frozen blueberries (note below if using frozen which I usually do) if using fresh measure them out and place in freezer while prepping the dough
* &frac12; cup whole milk
* &frac12; cup sour cream or Greek yoghurt
* 2 cups all purpose flour plus more for dusting
* &frac12; cup of sugar plus a couple of extra tsps for sprinkling scones before baking
* 2 tsp baking powder
* &frac14; tsp baking soda
* &frac12; tsp salt
* 1 tsp grated lemon or lime zest

&#42; if using frozen blueberries I measure them out and place them back in the freezer- do not thaw them out.  Right before adding them to the dough toss them in flour (approx half cup in a bowl) so they are completely coated in flour and then add them to dough according to directions
<br>
<br>

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425 &deg; F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper

1. In a medium sized bowl whisk together the milk, sour cream or yoghurt, and refrigerate until needed

1. In a separate bowl whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda salt and lemon or lime zest.

1. Add the frozen grated butter to the flour mixture and toss by hand until butter is thoroughly coated

1. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and fold with a spatula until just combined &ndash; will be very shaggy and not a compete mass of dough.

1. With the rubber spatula scoop out dough onto a very heavily flour dusted surface. Flour your hands and knead dough 6-8 times until it just holds together in a ragged ball adding flour as needed to prevent it from sticking

1. Flour your rolling pin and roll dough out into approx 12 inch square. Fold it into thirds like you would a letter, scrape with a bench scrapper or a metal spatula if needed. Lift the short ends and fold into thirds to form a square and then transfer dough to a plate that was lightly dusted with flour and put in the freezer to chill for 5 minutes.

1. Transfer dough to floured surface and using a floured rolling pin roll into a 12 inch square again

1. Remove the blueberries from the freezer and sprinkle them evenly over the surface of the dough pressing them gently into it so that they are embedded.

1. With a bench scraper, loosen dough from work surface and start to roll it pressing it to form a tight log. Finish rolling with the seam facing down and press the log with your hands into a 12x4 rectangle. Cut the rectangle crosswise into 4 equal rectangles and then cut each rectangle diagonally to form 2 triangles. Transfer each scone onto baking sheet.

1. If baking them immediately, brush with melted butter and sprinkle with sugar and bake until golden for approx 18-20 minutes.

1. Cool for 10 minutes and serve with more butter and drizzled with glaze or with it on the side

**To make ahead:**
After placing the scones on baking sheet, either refrigerate them over night covered with parchment and foil. When ready to bake brush with butter and sprinkle with sugar and bake as normal. If freezing make sure to cover them tight with plastic wrap and foil, remove from freezer place on baking sheet, butter and sprinkle with sugar heat oven to 375 instead and increase baking time to 25-30 minutes.
