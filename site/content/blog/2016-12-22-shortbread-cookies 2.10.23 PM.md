I have to tell you I wasn't a fan of these as a young kid. I think the messiness of the powdered sugar was a turn off.  Obviously I must have been a weird kid cause these things are pretty much amazing.  In my defence as I got older I grew to love them, all I had to do was try one. If you like shortbread cookies than you will love these. They totally melt in your mouth and that would be because butter is the star ingredient. The actual cookie is not overly sweet but the powdered sugar compensates for that.

They have a slight crunch from the added roasted almonds. Just a great great cookie!! You eat one and then you walk away and then you think about it until you have to turn back around and have another. It's just one of those foods that lingers and you just have to have more than one!! But remember to pace yourself as I said before they are practically made of all butter.

I fondly remember always having a butter cookie tin (which my mom reused for years) full of these around at all times.  These and **koulourakia** (another Greek biscuit) were staples in the house. They keep well and are great to have when you have unexpected guests over for coffee as Greeks always do and plus my mom was for the most part and is a housewife so coffee break with aunts and friends that would pop over in the day were made perfect with the addition of these cookies.  That's totally my mom's thing. She always has something homemade to offer anyone at anytime.  Don't you just dream of being a stay at home Mom/wife?!? I do!! #goals. I would never run out of things to do!! Anyways back to reality!!

Now when I crave them I can't just get my fix when I go to my mom's house. I have to make them myself!  This is my go to recipe for them that my mom gave me.  It's pretty basic and you have a little flexibility for adding more sugar or using less or more flour.  A simple sweet and delectable treat that you need to make.  Then sit back and enjoy them with a nice strong cup of coffee or tea!!

## Kourabiethes recipe:
Full recipe makes a couple trays of cookies &mdash; I usually half the recipe for a small batch
<br><br>

### Ingredients:

* 1 lb. unsalted  butter at room temperature
* 1 1/4 cup powdered sugar
* 2 egg yolks
* 3/4 cup olive oil
* 2 cups of roasted almonds,chopped
* 1 shot of cognac
* 2 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1 tbsp. of baking powder
* 5-6 cups of of all purpose flour, sifted

For the topping:

* 1/2 cup Rosewater (optional)
* Extra icing sugar for powdering (about 2 cups)
<br>


### Directions:

1. Preheat oven at 350 degrees
1. Roast the almonds on a baking sheet in the oven or on the stove top in a pan until lightly browned and toasted.  
1. In a large mixing bowl, beat together the butter and sugar. Then add the oil and add the egg yolks and beat for 10-15 minutes longer. (Yes you read it right, make sure to follow this step its critical to mix for that long to get the right texture)
1. Add 1-2 cups of flour and beat on low
1. Put the cognac in a small bowl and then add your baking powder and stir it until dissolved. Add this mixture, along with the vanilla extract and the nuts into the dough and continue beating until blended and the dough starts to come together
1. knead gently with your hands and continue adding the flour to the mixture a couple tbsps at a time until all the flour has been incorporated (you want the dough to retain moisture but not to be sticky or stick to your hands &mdash; add more or less flour accordingly)
1. Let the dough rest for up to a 1/2hour
1. Use a spoon or cookie scoop to spoon out some of the dough and form into a small patty or into a moon shape(feel free to use a cookie cutter). Place the cookies on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and bake for 25 minutes or until lightly golden
1. Remove from oven and sprinkle with rosewater, if using, while the cookies are hot, then gently roll into the powdered sugar place on cooling rack until completely cool
1. Once cool place some more icing sugar in a sifter and dust them with more icing sugar until well-coated.
