excerpt: <p>Can't make it to the spa? This scrub is effective and easy to make</p>
---

It's always a nice treat to be able to have a few minutes to yourself to do a little pampering.  I know with many of you especially you mom's, that putting moisturising body lotion on counts as pampering and so it should.  When we take a couple of minutes to do these simple things we feel a little better - for me I feel like a new person, and all it takes is some  dry brushing for a couple minutes and using my little DIY scrub in the shower. I feel like I washed away the day and can go on or at least feel a little rebooted.

That little routine is my favourite! I donâ€™t do it as often as I probably should but when I do I always try to get back into the routine of doing it.  I have spoken about the benefits of dry brushing in some of my IG stories but I will quickly just mention them again.  Dry brushing  is using a natural fibered body brush in its dry form, on dry skin and sweeping it gently but firmly over the skin in short but repetitive strokes. It helps in exfoliating the skin, shedding dead skin and thus improving its appearance (many attribute it to reducing the appearance of cellulite) and allowing itself to hydrate more effectively. It can help with ingrown hairs if that is an issue, and it helps improve vascular blood circulation and lymphatic drainage which of of course bring about all sorts of other benefits to the body and organs including your immunity.

The direction of your stokes is supposedly important and adds to it's effectiveness on the lymphatic system.  So basically you start at your feet and end up going bottom to top.  It's wise to avoid private areas, sensitive areas or open wounds and brushing should never be so hard that you break skin.  Your brushing strokes should always be towards your chest (this is where the lymph system drains). So when you are doing your legs strokes are upward-when doing neck and shoulders the strokes are downwards.  It's advised that when you reach the stomach you should use a counterclockwise circular stroke- I usually forget this part and continue doing upward strokes, but doing it that way also helps the body with detoxification and digestion and has something to do with the direction of the intestines.  The whole process should only take a couple of minutes.

> Super simple to make and also a great idea for a DIY gift

I usually do this a couple times a week and follow up with the coffee scrub which I make myself.  Super simple to make also a great idea for a DIY gift. It's three parts. One part ground coffee, one part coconut oil and one part either brown sugar or sea salt.  Many add other essential oils to it, and also add in extracts and cinnamon or other aromatics. You can do whatever you like. I'm really happy with the smell of the coffee and coconut oil itself so I keep it pretty basic. I keep it in an airtight container in the bathroom and scoop or spoon some out of it as I'm heading into the showers. Scrub scrub scrub and then shower as usual. (Keeping it in the shower itself introduces too much moisture and it could get moldy). Then I use Shea oil or coconut oil to moisturise after and I'm good as new!

The benefits to this coffee scrub other than aromatherapeutic cause who doesn't love the scent of coffee are: the caffeine in the coffee is a natural antioxidant that the skin can actually absorb and help neutralise free radicals and help in preventing premature ageing, it's exfoliating, the caffeine and the action of scrubbing combined also increase blood flow and the claim is that this helps reduce the appearance of cellulite. Also helping with this is the affect caffeine has in constricting blood vessels which can improve skin texture.

Lots of claims there! I love it and can't confirm all of those except that I love the smell of it and I love how soft my skin feels after all of it!! Any other things will just be a bonus. But since swimsuit season is upon many of us and is for me 365 days a year,  it's definitely worth a try.  There's also very little to lose as all those ingredients are fairly inexpensive and accessible to most people. So go ahead and give you or someone else you love the treat of a spa day or a at least a spa few minutes!
