excerpt: <p>Enjoy the natural beauty of the island in a rustic getaway</p>

Our weekend escape started at the height of Carnival. We survived many neighbourhood parties (fetes) and we were definitely ready to head out of the city by that point.  Living near the Captial is definitely convenient and awesome, but during the Carnival season it can be a little much. Fete after fete after fete. Literally noise and the faint hard bass from all directions.  Not to mention the traffic ensuing due to all of it as well.  Like I said before about it, if you aren't playing you need to get out or invest in some good ear plugs.

We decided to get out and booked to stay at Mt. Plaisir estate hotel in Grande Rivi√®re. We started out Sunday morning at around 8am and it took us about 2 & 1/2 hours. Not too bad. The roads were  generally really good on our trek there except for the last stretch of leg a couple miles away from the hotel.  Just lots of pot wholes and dives in the road. That's all and our little oldie of a car made it fine so nothing to really talk about. Just take it easy on the last stretch of the road. We made some stops along the way for pics and a little leg stretch. So the drive was relaxed and quite scenic and pleasant.

The place is super easy to to find we just used google maps to locate and navigate. As soon as you arrive you literally check out your stress and any pre-carnival frustrations and check in to peace and serenity. The hotel is inviting and rustic. Set in front of a bay literally steps away from the shore.  By far my favourite thing about it.  I will not and cannot ever tire of hearing the waves crashing all day and through the night.

The owner Piero (an Italian living in Trinidad) is super friendly and around for any help or inquiries.  Check in and check out was a breeze and staff is super friendly and helpful. The girls at the restaurant are super pleasant. The food is great and there's plenty to choose from at different price points and for different budgets.

There are many things to do around the hotel. We took many walks along the stretch of beautiful beach with a lot of photo opps.  There are hiking trails and excursions to see the turtles during turtle watching season. Our visit was too early for any sitings but we will definitely be back at the height of the season and will share more on that in a later post.

A few things about the hotel I wanted to share.  It's dog friendly. A few guests brought their dogs. It's very kid friendly and great for families. The long stretch of sandy beach is great for the kiddies to play in.  Since the beach is steps to the rooms it's very easy to keep a close eye on them as they play. The beach is a little on the rough side but that is no surprise since it is located on the north coast where the waters tend to be on the rougher side.  Not to say it's unswimmable but something to keep in mind.

As for our room (and I can only speak about our room which was on the ground floor) It was clean and rustic.  Don't expect brand new furnishings and state of the art electronics. In fact there were no electronics or appliances in our room and we survived! There was AC if you wanted it and mosquito nets over the bed. We were perfectly comfortable without the AC because the sea breeze was spectacularly cool and comfortable with a few windows open. There is warm to hot running water if you are wondering about that. We could hear the people on the upper level above our room only when they moved a chair around or something like that but not footsteps or voices.  We had no trouble with noise but something to keep in mind if your sensitive to noise.

We didn't know what to expect when we came but I did bring lots of snacks to munch on on the road trip up and for our stay which included tons of fruit and plantain chips and nuts and we also brought our own water and brought wine and chocolate too.

We brought bread and tomatoes and we're going to pick up cheese and stuff for sandwiches if we saw that the room had a mini fridge but it didn't.  That was totally fine though.  We saw some people bring coolers and they were keeping drinks and food items in there and refilling ice daily from a nearby shop (we also noticed people bringing microwaves and fans also). So there is that option but we just snacked and ate at the restaurant. Continental breakfast was included and that made things easier too.

If you're budget conscious I would definitely load up on healthy snacks and prepare non perishable goods like granola bars, energy balls and maybe some banana bread and fruits and stuff like that to bring. Basically healthy fillers in between meals to keep costs down and bring a cooler if you have perishable items that you feel you must bring.  We only stayed a couple of days so we were prepared to eat at the restaurant a few times.  There are a few other spots to eat at around the area but we stayed at the hotel for the most part due to convenience and the fact that we really just wanted to relax these few days we were here and not venture out too far.

This place is definitely built for that.  Be prepared to spend some
peaceful and relaxing time here on the north coast with pleasant people and great food. I was also really happy to have been able to try some of Piero's locally made ricotta cheese which was so creamy and delicious and definitely worth asking for when you stay.

I literally wrote this post while sitting on a big ol' Adirondack chair in front of our room enjoying the beach view and sound of the waves and the neighbour children scurrying around and giggling while they played on the sand, hoping that the hours didn't pass too quickly.  We would be back soon though, so that thought comforted me. Until next time Mt Plaisir!
