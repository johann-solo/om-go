excerpt: This refreshing spin on your typical tiramisu will not disappoint
---

This is a great recipe for anyone who loves tiramisu and anything light and creamy like a moussey dessert but don't let the lightness fool you, it's very rich. Personalised cups or glasses of it are the perfect portion size for a sweet treat like this. Whether you use fresh strawberries or if you are using frozen, it's wonderful both ways.

With the frozen ones I usually make them into a sauce by simmering the berries with some sugar &mdash; in this case I used coconut sugar and a squeeze or two of lime or lemon juice and a splash of vanilla.  Once it's reduced I take it off the heat and let it cool completely before layering. It's a darker richer red when you make the sauce this way especially if you are using coconut sugar. With the fresh, I macerate them in some sugar, lemon juice, vanilla and a splash of orange liqueur. Let them all hang out while you are making the creamy layer and until they turn into a thick syrup.

Now for the mascarpone! Well this recipe is a little different than a regular tiramisu that may call for using raw eggs &mdash; which I make all the time. I'm not opposed to it but I wanted to keep this eggless. So to create a lighter fluffier creamy layer I whipped up some whipping cream with a little sugar and vanilla and once fluffy folded it into the softened mascarpone. There is a dilemma with the mascarpone. I can't always get or find it here, so I have included my go to recipe below on how I make homemade mascarpone. Before everyone gets up in arms about it though, I will qualify it by saying that the texture is not exactly the same and even the taste isn't exactly the same but if you want something close to mascarpone and can't get the real deal this totally works.

Let's talk about those spongy layers. I use lady fingers but if you can't get your hands on any then definitely use a sponge cake like you would in a trifle. I don't have trouble finding them here so I stick to the lady fingers.  And if you want to be super adventurous and you have lots of time on your hands (I'm super jealous if that's the case) by all means make your own lady fingers. There's lots of great recipes out their for making them from scratch and all the best to you!! To moisten them I use some orange juice and orange liqueur.  I also like to add a splash of orange blossom water but that is completely optional. The light citrus flavours complement the strawberry well and the freshly squeezed orange juice adds just enough sweetness. To top these little beauties I just do the same as my regular tiramisu. I  sift some cocoa powder on them or I drizzle a little more of the sauce. Either way is great!

This is a pretty simple recipe. There are a few easy steps involved and a few bowls to clean but it's worth it cause they are so pretty and so refreshingly delicious especially with the fresh berries.  The frozen ones that get the heat treatment are just as delicious but definitely have a richer deeper flavour, more decadent and a heavier dessert-like flavour. I tend to make them with the frozen because they are never in season here and can only get the ones imported and those never taste the same as locally grown berries.  Whatever way you chose to make them, you and whoever gets a serving of these will be happy!

Recipe makes 4-6 tiramisu cups depending on the size and if you are making it into a dish then I would definitely double the recipe
<br>
<br>

### Ingredients:
<br>

**Cake layers**

* 12 Ladyfingers
* 2 tbsp triple sec (or liqueur of your choice &mdash; I like using orange liqueur for this though)
* 1 cup of freshly squeezed orange juice
* 1 tsp of orange blossom water (optional)
<br>

**Cream layers**

* 1 tub of mascarpone at room temp (approx 1&frac12; - 2 cups)
* 1 cup of heavy whipping cream
* &frac14; cup of granulated sugar
* &frac12; tsp vanilla extract
<br>

**Strawberry syrup layers**

* 2 cups of strawberries fresh or frozen chopped In half or quarters if they are large berries
* &frac12; cup of coconut sugar or sugar of choice
* 1 tbsp of lemon juice
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1 tsp of triple sec (optional)
* 1 tbsp of cocoa powder for dusting
<br>

### Directions

1. For the strawberries if you are making from fresh toss the berries in the sugar and the rest of the ingredients and set aside while preparing the rest of the layers stirring  them occasionally. You can do this with the frozen ones as well but will take a lot longer to thaw and macerate so if you are using this same method with the frozen ones make sure to account for thawing time.

1. For the stovetop version using the frozen just combine all ingredients into a small sauce pan and heat to medium and let its simmer away until reduced. This also works with fresh but I prefer macerating fresh berries.

1. Place the mascarpone in a large bowl and mix or whisk it by hand gently until soft and creamy - do not over mix. In a separate bowl combine the heavy cream sugar and vanilla and beat until stiff peaks form. Gently add and fold the whip cream into the mascarpone in three additions. Fill a piping bag with cream filing and store in the fridge while prepping the rest of the steps.

1. In a medium size bowl combine the liquids for the cake layer. Soak the lady fingers in the bowl individually for a few seconds flipping them once and set them aside (if you are making the tiramisu in cups you can break the ladyfingers in half before or after soaking for them to fit glasses &mdash; I find after soaking is easier)

1. Layering: this is where preference rules. I like to do a little cream on the bottom then the lady fingers and then syrup. I change the fingers and cream layers up but what I don't change is the sequence of the fingers and syrup. I always top the fingers with the syrup so that they soak up the liquid of the syrup otherwise the syrup will start to blend or seep through the cream and look a little messier-that doesn't change the flavours at all it just keeps the layers more distinct and neat looking. I also like to pipe  the cream into the cups because it easier and less messy but you definitely can just spoon it in as well. I like to end off with a layer of cream and the I dust it with cocoa powder. I like to do some like that and some with a little syrup drizzled over the top.

## Mascarpone recipe adapted from FOOD52
Makes approx 2 cups worth
<br>
<br>

### Ingredients:

* 2 cups heavy cream
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
<br>

### Tools:
* Thermometer
* Strainer
* Cheese cloth or clean dish towel for straining
<br>

### Directions:

* In a medium sauce pan, on medium heat, slowly bring the heavy cream to a very low simmer( want the temp to reach 180 degrees F, this is where a thermometer comes in handy, and you want the temp to hang around that as a maximum)

* Once it reaches that temp let it simmer for 3 minutes and then add the lemon juice

* Let simmer for another 3 min and remove from heat and let cool to room temp, approx. 30 minutes.

* Setup your strainer over a large bowl and line with the cheesecloth should be folded to make at least 3 layers if not four

* Pour cream through and then wrap the bowl in plastic wrap or something to cover it and place in the fridge over night to fully strain so it's a nice and thick consistency.

* The next day scrape out the cheese  into a bowl and use in place of mascarpone
