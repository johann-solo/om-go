I thought this post would be a good one to tell you guys a little bit about what I eat and who I am when it comes to food.  A few of my followers on IG have asked if I subscribe to a certain diet and I thought I would let you all know about it. First off, I am not vegan, vegetarian (I have my days though!), celiac, gluten intolerant, lactose intolerant and whatever other category for intolerance their might be.
<br><br>

I have had allergy tests, sensitivity tests galore and I have heard it all.  But the one thing I know for certain is that I am allergic to cats and some dogs (cats mostly &mdash; not deathly just sneezing and itchiness), dust, ragweed and I suffered (past tense because it's only when I'm back home in Canada that I suffer with it) with whatever is in the air in the spring. Is it hay fever? Those things are for certain.

I have been told I have a sensitivity to wheat, corn, dairy, some nuts(but not specific) night shade vegetables and a few other things that I'm not remembering right now, and I believe them to be totally correct, at the time of being tested at least.  I have learned a few things about my body and digestion over the last few years and realised that when I am under a lot of stress my gut health is directly affected.  I should say &mdash; severely affected.  I become very sensitive to a lot of foods that I eat on the regular. Like eggs, wheat, tomatoes (the usual suspects).  I can get hives and it's almost like my system shuts down and nothing sits well in my tummy. If it gets like that I know that along with reducing stress, I have to cut out some of the foods that give me trouble.  
<br>

Usually though, when everything is sort of normal I stay away from wheat pasta because I find that really affects me (tummy and skin &mdash; funny enough it's mainly pasta because having bread does not create the same feeling unless of course I eat a whole pizza) and I also stay away from too much dairy which has the same affect. What's too much dairy? Well it sometimes depends on the dairy.  Usually I won't eat a big bowl of ice cream, drink a glass of milk, have milk in a big bowl of cereal, but i can definitely eat a couple slices of cheese in my sandwich, some feta (cause I gotta have that), and some yoghurt although I won't eat yoghurt everyday.  But all in moderation. It's good to pay attention to your body and see how it reacts to things.

What I don't do or almost never eat is deep fried food.  I do indulge in the occasional sharing of fries, and fried chicken, but it's a big rarity.  I love fried pies but I never have them.  I love pastries but I try not to eat them too often. I find greasy food, processed food, food with a lot of additives and 'fake' seasoning, and preservatives really does a number on me.  I feel it the same day or the next.  It's not in my head either because my skin reacts to it too. So Im not going to say I never have bad food but I usually choose not to because of the consequences.  Ask my husband &mdash; I'm not fun!! So in summary I like to eat healthy. I love greens and veggies so much. Can never tire of them and fruit and I like and try to eat 'real' food. Food that you can ID all ingredients. Thats why I also love to cook.  I know exactly what I'm putting into my body.

I love to experiment with different recipes too for those times when I am being affected by wheat and eggs more so than normal.  And I do have some gluten intolerant, and vegan people in my life too so it's nice to try recipes that I know I can make for them.

I find our non wheat flours are super expensive here in Trinidad so
I avoid buying and using them if I can and try to find recipes that don't require them. This is one of them.  This original recipe is listed and called a vegan banana bread.  Now ask my husband and he will tell you that's a lie.  Not the vegan part but the banana bread part.  And I see where he is coming from. It doesn't have the same taste and texture as a regular banana bread but I think it's still delicious. It's moist and I ate it all week with peanut butter so it was my yummy toast replacement.  I switched a few things up to suit what I had available.  All in all I think this recipe is a total thumbs up.  But definitely don't expect it to taste like my classic banana bread recipe.

Enjoy! I'm recipe testing another vegan bread this weekend and will keep you guys posted. This is definitely a winner though if you want a sugar free bread and egg free bread.  You could also make it gluten free if you use gluten free oats and add in some cranberries or chocolate chips for a little extra sweetness. I loved to have mine topped with PB and some goji berries.
