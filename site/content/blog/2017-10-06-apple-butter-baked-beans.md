We ate these beans as pictured, with lots of biscuits but days later we were still eating them with eggs and toast &ndash; they were so good and we were sad when we finally ate the last of them.

These can be eaten as a meal in themselves just add these delicious biscuits (recipe below) and some greens or slaw and call it dinner!! They are also fabulous as a side for just about anything especially if you’re feeding a crowd.

You can use dried beans in the recipe and they would be wonderful but feel free to use canned as well.  I like to have the option of both. Sometimes I don’t have time to make from dry so having the canned option is always good. If you are making them from dry use approx 1 lb. of them and make sure to soak them overnight, rinse and then cook them in boiling stock approx 5 cups of it adding more if needed until they are basically cooked though. They will do a little more cooking in the oven when baking with the sauce.

If you don’t have pigtail or don’t want to use it, go right ahead and use some bacon or
Pancetta or salt-pork even too. I love how the pork gives the beans a salty, smokey flavour. They can most definitely be made meatless too just leave the meat out and they are just as wonderful.

1. Then add in the beans with liquid (you can drain and rinse instead and add water instead - approx 1 &frac14; cups plus more if needed) and allow them to sauté for a couple of minutes

1. Then add the all the sauce ingredients and bring to a boil and once boiling transfer to a baking/casserole dish (approx 8x10 dish or if your pot is oven proof feel free to leave in the pot) and roast for approx 45 min to 60 minutes or until beans are thick and bubbling

## Homemade Apple Butter

### Ingredients
Yields approx 1 to 1½ cups of apple butter

* 2-2½ lbs apples (approx 8-10 small apples)
* ½ cup Apple cider vinegar
* ½ cup pure apple juice or cider
* ¾ cup coconut sugar or brown sugar
* 1 tbsp maple syrup
* ¼ tsp vanilla extract
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* ¼ tsp ground allspice
* ¼ tsp ground nutmeg
* Pinch of ground clove
* Pinch of salt

### Directions
1. Wash and scrub apples well, core and slice apples and add them to a medium sized pan (peel and all) adding with them the Apple cider vinegar and also the apple juice. Bring to a boil and reduce to a low simmer, cover and let simmer for 20 minutes.
2. Remove lid, stir the apples and continue to simmer them for another 20-30 minutes until the apples are very tender and have thickened from breaking down and then remove them from the heat and allow them to cool for a few minutes.
3. Put the apples in a food processor (being very careful especially if they are still on the hot side) and process until smooth or use a potato masher and mash until they are smooth.
4. Transfer the processed apples to a fine mesh sieve over a bowl and press the pulp through the sieve so that your left with a creamy smooth apple purée
5. Put the purée back into the pot turn the heat back on to medium low and add the remaining ingredients. Cook stirring occasionally until the apple butter is a deep rich colour, the sugar has melted through and it’s nice and thick (won’t take longer than 5-10 minutes).
6. Remove from heat and let cool for a few minutes and transfer to a sealed container and it can last for up to a month refrigerated.
