excerpt: Game day or any day is a good excuse to whip these up
---

Let gets something out of the way right off the bat. Game day is not my thing at all.  I'm not a fan of football. I don't get it and don't get the hype. I am more of a hockey and basketball fan probably because I also enjoyed playing those sports growing up and because my dad is a huge hockey fan. Anyways I do love game food.  I love wings, nachos, dips, you name it! So any excuse to make or partake and I'm in. This year the Patriots are in the super bowl and my brother in law is a huge fan.  We were invited to his place to watch and also enjoy a little munchkin loving time with my niece and nephew. That's what I'm most excited for plus the food.

One thing T&T is lacking is some good old bar food. I miss going out for beer and wings or beer and a good 'ol plate of cheesy nachos. Don't get me wrong we do have a few places that serve some alright bar food but bar food is a little "exotic" here.  Meaning it's not common so "exotic" means really expensive for something that is super cheap back home.  Beer and wing night back home is not a bust the bank kind of night. I fondly remember going for half price wings and pitchers with a side of nachos on a Tuesday in Hamilton and never paying more than 20 bucks. Anyways that isn't the case here so when I have the craving I just make for myself.

I'm super conscious of healthy eating but I do love my junk food too! I totally believe that if you're generally healthy, a cheat day once in a while will not kill you and you don't need to go into full out heavy detox mode or panic mode because you had a fries supreme at Taco Bell (what these loaded nachos are named after).  A healthy body is made to digest and get rid of things that need getting rid of.  Habitual eating of bad foods, well plainly, I don't agree with. But occasionally it is ok.

Back to these loaded nachos. They taste amazing and are definitely a little healthier than nachos or fries supreme at Taco Bell cause you're using real ingredients and no processed cheese. So it's a junk food but of the good kind.  If you know what I mean.  Hehehe! At least that's what I tell myself.

These are also pretty easy to put together and they literally get licked up fast so be sure to make more than one tray! You won't regret it! Another good thing about this is you can load these nachos with anything you want. Customise them by adding beans, corn, red onion, do them meatless, different cheeses, literally anything you like.  
<br>

Simple, quick, serves a crowd, and versatile meaning use what ya got in the fridge and pantry! What more could you ask for in a game day or any day cheat snack? Hope everyone enjoys game day or if you're like me enjoy the commercials and half time show!
