excerpt: Tasty popsicles with probiotic goodness

---

Popsicles totally remind me of summer holidays as a kid! Hearing the ice cream man's  bell ringing from his bike was the highlight of the day! That bell called every child running out of their homes or running inside their house yelling and asking for change for ice cream.
<br>

My favourite thing to buy was ice cream sandwiches and orange plain popsicles depending on what he had that day. No matter how old you are popsicles are a beloved hot weather treat and they bring out the inner kid in us!
<br>
<br>

These ones are made with goat milk kefir and add creaminess to the pops like creamsicles. They also add some protein, probiotics, and enzymes that help with gut health.  So why not whip up a batch of these and enjoy them without getting the sugar rush you got when you were younger after a visit to the ice cream truck!
