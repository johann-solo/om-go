My ultimate favourite granita is a coffee one which I will be making and sharing another time. I had it in Italy and was simply the best.  That was one of my favorite experiences with granita.

Although I love my coffee I also love my fruit and wanted to make something with some of the local ingredients that are in season right now.  I first thought mango but I wanted to do a boozy granita and didn't quite know what to pair with mango so I decided on pineapple because I instantly thought of rum punch! I also love pineapple and I wouldn't have to worry about straining it. The simpler the better! That is how my thought process went for the making of this simple, sweet and totally fabulous granita recipe.

The fruit is really the star of this granita. It has all the tropical feels in it with a little spice which is typical of a rum punch, at least here in Trinidad. The granita itself is wonderful so feel free to leave out the rum if you don't want it boozy.  This was so simple to make and I think it would be a great base recipe to do with all sorts of other fruit like watermelon, strawberries and definitely mango too (don't let me discourage you from the mango one). So many options!

If you have never tried making granita &mdash; what are ya waiting for? It's so easy to make and it's so versatile and perfect for feeding a crowd during those hot summer months when you have people over for a BBQ and can't stand the thought of turning on your oven to bake a thing (that's how I feel 365 days a year over here near the equator).

Its super easy and can be made ahead and in fact it's good for up to two weeks sealed in the freezer. So glad for that cause I'm definitely going to need some after I'm done this post.  I had the longest day ever cleaning teeth and I could literally use a bowl not a cup of this. On the upside I got my IG account verified today by **fohrcard.com** so yay! Now the world knows I'm 'authentic', a real person and not a bot. Social media is a crazy roller coaster ride that excites me but sometimes scares me and makes me queasy  and some days you just want off the ride! Let's just say this first year of blogging has been very interesting and full of many lessons. Looking forward to my second year.  Someone said it gets easier after the first year and I thought how is that possible? It totally does though! So glad I toughed it out the year and excited for all the happy projects and things I will be involved in in the next few months! Thanks for listening to my jibber jabber! Now go make this stellar granita!!!!!
