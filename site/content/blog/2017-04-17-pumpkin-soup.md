excerpt: A classic soup that's simple and quick to whip up

---

Here in Trinidad pumpkin is a major food staple. From making it into a sweet bread to adding it to your callaloo or having it curried- it's everywhere. The most common variety we have here is called crapaud (French for frog) back pumpkin named for its thick and knobby skin. I love it!! The flavour is sweet and it cooks down smooth and can be incorporated into so much.  One of the things I love making with it is pumpkin soup! It's so easy and cooks down fast too so you can have dinner ready in a pinch.

This recipe is versatile when it comes to flavours too. I simply use salt pepper and thyme but you can definitely take it down a sweeter route adding some nutmeg and cinnamon and adding some maple syrup at the end. I especially love it when I'm not feeling so well or feel like I might be coming down with something. It's a lot less work than making chicken soup (which I love by the way-not knocking it in anyway) and just as comforting! It's great with a side sandwich this one being a super decadent grilled cheese one made with extra sharp white cheddar and bacon. Perfect to dip into that soup with!

### Ingredients

* 2lbs pumpkin
* 2-3 tbsp EVOO plus an extra tbsp
* 1tbsp butter
* 1-2 tsp of fresh thyme
* 1 carrot peeled and chopped
* 1 large onion chopped
* 1-2 stalks celery chopped
* 2 cloves garlic minced
* 4-5cups of broth or water
* 1/4 cup of regular cooking cream or coconut cream
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Directions

1. Roast pumpkin at 350 degrees F for approx 30 min or until tender -either halved or as I do it peeled and chopped into chunks drizzled in EVOO or coconut oil, tossed with salt and pepper and half of the fresh thyme before roasting

1. Meanwhile in a soup pot heated to Med-high saut√© all the veggies and rest of the thyme in the remaining oil and the butter until soft approx 8-10 min

1. Toss in the pumpkin when done roasting and add broth so that it barely covers it (more if you want a thinner soup) and let simmer for another 10-15 minutes.

1. Use an emersion blender or blend in batches in a regular blender. Stir in the cream and season with salt and pepper. I topped mine with an extra drizzle of cream and some very crispy kale chips I had made.
