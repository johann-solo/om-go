excerpt: A simple to make bundt with a touch of spice and espresso and an
  unforgettable glaze
---

This was a wonderful bundt cake that we really enjoyed. The combo of it and that luscious glaze was on point.  I did have to make it three times to get it right and the way I wanted it though.  There was just something wrong with it texturally.  Nothing wrong with the recipe at all but I think sometimes variations in flours can make a difference. One of the biggest differences too was that I used homemade pumpkin purée. Maybe the slight extra moisture in the pumpkin was what was throwing off the texture.  Anyways with some very minor tweaks the third time really was a charm and it turned out just the way I wanted.

The original recipe called for the sugar – coffee swirl to be almost tossed in streusel like – that didn’t work for me because that was another factor affecting the texture.  The pictures of it in the original recipe looked perfect and had a beautiful swirl through the cake.  I couldn’t achieve that at all with the way the recipe instructed. I don’t know why and I likely was doing something wrong but whatever it was it wasn’t working for me so I mixed the sugar coffee mixture into some of the batter and then layered it and it turned in not the swirl effect I wanted and the texture was just right.

The cake itself isn’t as heavy as some bundts can be. Its a little on the lighter side and would be perfect with a cup of coffee accentuating the expresso in it even further. It’s lightly spiced which goes so well with the pumpkin.

The pièce de résistance is really the glaze! It’s not only fabulous on this cake but eaten by the  spoonful and I definitely see this glaze over rum and raisin ice cream, waffles and so much more!

This is a pretty simple bundt to make with so much flavour and I know you will love it just as much as we did along with some of our neighbours who we shared all three bundts with. You won’t regret making that glaze either! Enjoy!

* &frac14; tsp of ground ginger
* &frac14; tsp ground nutmeg

<br>

**for the espresso filling**
* 1/3 cup of coconut sugar or brown sugar
* 1 tbsp of espresso powder or instant coffee powder
* &frac12; tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 tsp of cocoa powder
* 1 cup of cake batter
<br>

**for the chocolate espresso rum glaze**
* 2/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips
* &frac14; cup heavy cream
* 1 &frac12; tbsp of dark rum
* &frac14; tsp of vanilla extract
* 1 tsp of espresso powder of instant coffee powder
<br>

### Directions
**for the bundt**
1. Preheat oven to 350 &deg; F and heavily grease your pan or pans (every nook and cranny) and lightly dust with a bit of flour and set aside

1. In a medium sized bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and spices and set aside

1. In a small bowl whisk together all the dry ingredients for the espresso filling and set aside

1. In a large mixing bowl beat together the pumpkin purée, eggs, oil, both sugars, and the vanilla extract until well blended. Slowly beat in the dry ingredients until you have a smooth batter and everything is incorporated.

1. Remove approx 1 cup of cake batter and whisk it together with the sugar and espresso filling until chocolatey and smooth

1. Fill the pan/pans with 1/3 of the batter, then pour in half the espresso filling over the batter.  Spoon over another third of the batter over that and then pour the rest of the espresso filling over it. Spoon over the last bit of batter and smooth with a spatula or the back of a spoon.

1. Place pan on a baking sheet  and bake for 50 - 60 minutes or until done and toothpick inserted comes out clean. Allow cake to cool in pan for 15 minutes before inverting onto a cooling rack to cool the rest of the way
(my mini bundts took approx 15 minutes less time to bake).
<br>

**for the glaze**
1. In a small sauce pan over low heat melt the chocolate chips and whisk  together with the cream, coffee and vanilla extract.
1. Once it’s smooth take off the heat and stir in the rum.
1. Allow to cool for a few minutes before pouring it over the cake so that it has a thicker consistency and is easier to pour.

## Homemade Pumpkin Purée

### Ingredients
*	1 whole pumpkin 4-6 lbs or cut pumpkin pieces
*	Pinch of salt<br>
<br>

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400 ° F
1. Line one or two baking sheets with parchment paper
1. Slice pumpkin open and scoop out the seeds and fibers (reserve seeds for roasting or something else at another time) and cut up into 1-½ inch square pieces removing the skin
1. Arrange the pieces on baking sheet or sheets and sprinkle with salt and then roast them for 20-40 minutes until fork or knife can easily be inserted
1. Let sheet cool on cooling rack until you pumpkin can be handled and then transfer it all to a food processor and process until the flesh is smooth. Store in the fridge for up to one week and freeze for up to 3 months.
<br>

\* You can also cut the whole pumpkin in half and roast pieces whole but this takes longer to roast and more work to scrape off the flesh from the skin after. I do both and result is the same it just depends on how much time I have on hand and how lazy I am to chop and peel the pumpkin.

\# you can also boil the pumpkin in water until softened and water evaporates but I prefer roasting it because it develops a unique sweetness and a nuttiness as well.
