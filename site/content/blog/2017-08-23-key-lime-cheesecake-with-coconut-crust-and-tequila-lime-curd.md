Any procrastinators out there? Well, I'm having one of those procrastinating kind of evenings! I have so so so many things to do and yet I just want to sit and drink tea and scroll through my friend's posts on Instagram.

I kind of wish there were 5 extra hours in a day. That way I could sleep for one extra hour or maybe two, have more time with friends and family and have more time to cook and bake beautiful things like this crazy good cheesecake!! We all know that would not happen if we had five extra hours in a day! Somehow we would end up working more and wasting more time! Guess we will never know.

But what you will know if you make this cheesecake is just how good it is! I love cheesecake but in moderation. I like small junior sized pieces because cheesecake is usually a rich and decadent dessert perfect for sharing. That's my take on it but not everyone feels that way about cheesecake, like my husband for example.

I literally only make cheesecake when we are having a big group over. I do this purposely because if I make it just for us, my husband eats the entire cheesecake, spread over a week but still, a whole cheesecake!

Anyways where I'm getting at with all that is, I can only have a bite or two and I'm done-too rich after that. Well folks not with this one, as soon as the shoot was over I had to taste it, as with all the food I shoot.

That actually annoys my husband so much. He is always telling me,' Why don't we clean up and then eat?' And I reply 'impossible!' And carry on eating. I couldn't stop at one bite of this cheesecake and neither could he. There were no words about cleaning up. We sat quietly enjoying 1 and then for some of us 2 pieces of this cake.

It's still rich and decadent but the lime in the cake and curd really brighten it up and cut through the richness somehow.  This curd, by the way, is adapted from a Martha Stewart recipe and is by far the best curd recipe I have tried! It's very hard to screw up.

The unsweetened whip cream on top really lightens it up and is a perfect balance to the sweetness of the cake.  The crust is made with graham crackers and shredded coconut and just the right amount of coconutty flavour adding another layer of goodness to the cake.

I think I have said enough about it and shared enough boring interactions between me and the hubby!  There is soo much yumminess in this cheesecake and I hope you give it a whirl! You won't be disappointed. Not a fan of citrus cheesecakes? Hmm, that's what I thought but apparently, I am. So no excuses - give it a try and you will see!

### Ingredients

**For the Crust**

* 1½ cups of graham cracker crumbs (or crumbs made from digestive biscuits)
* ¼ cup melted butter plus more if needed for mixture to be moistened
* ½ cup sweetened flaked/shredded coconut
* 1 tsp pure coconut extract
* 1 pinch of salt
* Preheat oven to 350 &deg; F
* Combine all ingredients in a bowl and stir until crumbs are moistened and can hold together if pressed into side of bowl
* Transfer mixture to your springform pan and press evenly across the bottom of the pan
* Bake for 10-15 minutes until golden
* Once done remove from oven and set aside

**For the filling**

* 4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
* 1⅔ cups sugar
* ¼ cup cornstarch
* 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
* 2 large eggs
* ¼ cup heavy whipping cream
* 1 tbsp freshly grated lime zest
* ½ cup lime juice

### Directions

 1. Cream Cheese Filling: Place one 8-ounce package of the cream cheese, 1/3 cup of the sugar, and the cornstarch in a large bowl.
 2. Beat with an electric mixer on low until creamy, about 3 minutes, then beat in the remaining 3 packages of the cream cheese.
 3. Increase the mixer speed to high and beat in the remaining 1 1/3 cups of the sugar, then beat in the vanilla.
 4. Blend in the eggs, one at a time, beating the batter well after each one.
 5. Blend in heavy cream, lime zest and lime juice. At this point mix the filling only until completely blended. Be careful not to overmix the batter.
 6. Gently spoon the cheese filling on top of the baked crust layer.
 7. Place the springform pan in a large shallow pan containing hot water that comes about 1 inch up the side of the pan - water bath is optional but helps prevent the cheesecake from cracking(make sure you wrap your pan tight with a few layers of foil to prevent water from seeping through).
 8. Bake the cheesecake until the centre barely jiggles when you shake the pan, about 1 hour.
 9. Cool the cake on a wire rack for 1 hour.
10. Then cover the cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate until it’s completely cold, at least 4 hours or overnight.
11. Remove the sides of the springform pan.Slide the cake off of the bottom of the pan onto a serving plate. Or, if you wish, simply leave the cake on the removable bottom of the pan and place it on a serving plate.

**For the Tequila lime curd**

* ½ cup sugar
* 1½ tbsp of cornstarch
* 4 large egg yolks
* 2 tsp of lime zest
* 6 tbsp of freshly squeezed lime juice
* 3 tbsp of unsalted butter at room temperature
* ½ tsp sea salt
* 1 tbsp tequila
* 1½ tsp triple sec

### Directions

1. In a small sauce pan whisk together the sugar and cornstarch
2. Place on medium heat and add your yolks, lime zest, juice, butter, and salt and whisk continuously until thickened. Do not be tempted to increase the heat. Keep it to medium and just​ keep whisking. Increasing the heat with scald or cook the yolks and your curd will tasty eggy — so just be patient!
3. Once thick strain through a fine mesh sieve into a bowl and stir in the tequila and triple sec.
4. Press plastic wrap directly on the surface of the curd to prevent skin from forming and refrigerate until needed.
5. Once the cheese cake is completely​ cool as well as the lime curd.  Spread the lime curd over the cheesecake and let is set for 10-20 minutes.

**For the topping**

* ½ cup of whipping cream
* ½ vanilla extract
* 2 tbsp sugar (optional- I never add it but you can if you want it sweetened)

### Directions

1. Place all ingredients in a large mixing bowl and mix all ingredients with a mixer until light and fluffy
2. Top cheesecake and curd with whipping cream and decorate with slice of lime or lime zest
