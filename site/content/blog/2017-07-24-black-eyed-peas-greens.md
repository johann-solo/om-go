  <p>A delicious, nourishing and Mediterranean take on a bean salad. Perfect
  side or a main as I like it &mdash; served either warm or cold</p>

This dish is probably more Mediterranean than Greek but we Greeks sure love it! Traditionally its made with beet greens or some kind of wild green.  But when all you have is kale you make it with kale, but this would be equally delicious with spinach, Swiss chard  and all sorts of other leafy greens.  You can even use a combo of them in the recipe.

You can serve it as a side but I think it makes for a perfect summer afternoon lunch served as I have it with lots of bread, sliced juicy tomatoes, feta and an assortment of olives. This would be wonderful with a nice bottle of refreshing white wine to wash it all down with. We Greeks also like to eat beans with a side of fresh chives too. My dad always had to have a whole stalk of chives while he ate his lentil soup. I thought it was the weirdest thing until I tried it! Something you will just have to try yourself before you make up your mind on. Be prepared for some insane onion breath though and a nap after a pleasant lunch like that.

Our local dill that we have access to here is not like traditional lemony dill I'm use to. I'm sure it's in the dill family but to me it tastes like fennel fronds.  This dish tastes wonderful with the addition of fennel! Fennel is not always easy to find nor is it worth the money either when you do finally locate a sad looking one. So I like combining the celery with our local dill and you get a little of the fennel essence in the dish.  Regular dill and celery are still fabulous. Fennel just adds a different dimension of flavour but not necessary for this dish.

This is a great way to eat your greens and an extra bean salad recipe to have in your arsenal packed with fresh flavors! Hope you enjoy this Mediterranean classic!

&#42; **Cooking dried black eyed peas**

I like to soak mine for a few hours in a large bowl of water
Drain and rinse and place them in a large saucepan covered with water at least by 2 inches. Bring to boil and then drain again.  Put them back in the pot with same amount of water and this is when I like to add my aromatics like a clove or two of garlic, bay leave, and even some onions and salt and pepper. Bring them to a boil and then reduce the heat and cover and simmer them for approx. 30 minutes or until beans are just tender then drain them and discard aromatics. Set beans aside until you have to add them in step number 3
