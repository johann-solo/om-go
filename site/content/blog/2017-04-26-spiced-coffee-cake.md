As far as coffee cakes go, this has to be one of my husband's favourite and most requested cake. He is not the only one either. I have served this for brunch and also for dessert and it's always a hit. It's a humble and simple little cake yet it has some really nice flavours in it. The texture is just right especially with a bit of the crunch from the streusel, and the glaze gives it a little stickiness &mdash; something that I think the cake needs and the original recipe was missing.

The cake is airy and slightly crumbly yet also moist.  It's perfect with a cup of coffee just like the name of the cake suggest but equally good with a nice cup of earl grey! So perfect with an afternoon tea! There is absolutely no coffee in this cake, something that many thought when I first posted the picture of it on social media.  It's merely called a coffee cake, something that any cake can be called, but the term is most often used for cakes with a German ring to them like a streusel cake or cake with a streusel on or in them. Just thought I would clarify in case you were expecting a coffee kick from this cake.

You definitely can go without the caramel rum glaze but why would you do that? All jokes aside you can  go without it or you can omit the rum if you wanted it to be alcohol free. It would be just as delicious!

There are a few steps involved in making the cake since you are making a streusel and a glaze separately but all the components of the cake are fairly easy to make and quick. What I love about this cake is that all the ingredients are pretty basic too.  That is a plus for me since most uncommon ingredients are like 3-4 times the price of what they are back home.  Most of the ingredients are pantry items. The only thing I had to get that I don't usually have at home is the sour cream. And of course if you're not a baker, the cake flour and powdered sugar.  So there you have it! A simple cake, basic ingredients, a definite crowd pleaser and the perfect accompaniment to a hot beverage! All you can ask for in a coffee cake!  Hope you give it a try and if you do, please let me know. I love all the feedback!

* 3/4 cup chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)
<br>

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F

1. Grease and flour a tube pan

1. In a medium sized bowl prep the streusel. Place the sugar, flour, cinnamon, salt and butter in the bowl and combine to form a crumble using your fingers, pastry cutter or two butter knives. Add in the nuts if using after it's all crumbled and store in the fridge while you prep everything else

1. In a medium sized bowl sift together all the dry ingredients flour, spices, baking soda and powder, and salt and set aside

1. In a large mixing bowl cream butter with sugar with a mixer for approx 4-5 minutes

1. Add the eggs one at a time mixing well in between, then add the vanilla and sour cream

1. Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and mix on low until
everything is just combined. Finish mixing with a spatula scraping sides and bottom of bowl ensuring the batter is completely mixed

1. Spoon and spread half the batter into the pan smoothing it out as flat as possible.

1. Sprinkle 3/4 of the streusel over it

1. Spoon the rest of batter spreading it out and then top with the remaining streusel

1. Place pan on baking sheet and bake for 50-60 minutes or until tester comes out clean

1. Let the cake cool on cooling rack for approx. 30 minutes, make the rum glaze/sauce (recipe below) in the meantime.

1. Then carefully transfer to serving plate and drizzle the glaze over the entire cake. I like to reserve a bit of it to drizzle over individual pieces when I'm serving.
