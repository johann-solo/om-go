excerpt: <p>An elegant tender almost custard-like dessert that’s quick and easy to make and pleases the masses</p>
---

This was my first go of experimenting making clafoutis/clafouti and I was pleasantly surprised at how quick and easy it was to whip up. I experimented with a kingaurthorflour.com recipe and a thekitchn.com one and came up with this one which works really well. I look forward to experimenting with different fruit.

It’s a French baked dessert  traditionally made with cherries, pits included which apparently release something similar to almond extract when they are baked, adding to the overall flavour of the dessert.

You can really make it with any kind of tender fruit like berries and stone fruit- basically all the summer fruits, but any fruit or even chocolate and nuts can be incorporated once you have the basic batter down.  I would love to make one with cherries and I think blackberries would be delicious in it too!

I hadn’t baked anything with plums this season yet, and thought plums would be fabulous with this, and the purple tones would look really nice in it too. I’m happy I used them! Beautiful and delicious!

It’s an elegant dessert and definitely easier to make than a cake or pie. The batter is as easy to whip up as waffle batter.  It ends up almost custard-like or creamy with slightly crisp edges.

There you have it &ndash; a very simple and versatile recipe for a deliciously elegant dessert! If you haven’t already made one definitely do. I will make this over and over again because it’s one of my husbands favourite desserts - and a great recipe to have on hand especially for dinner parties.  What fruits do you plan on using for yours?

### Ingredients

* 1 tbsp butter
* 2 cups sliced plums
* 1 cup whole milk or cream
* &frac12; cup of sugar
* 3 eggs
* 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
* &frac14; tsp pure almond extract
* &frac12; cup all purpose flour
* 1 tsp grated orange zest
* &frac14; tsp salt

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and grease or butter a 9-10 inch pie pan or cast iron pan and set aside

1. Wash, pit and slice your plums very thinly and set aside

1. In a blender or food processor combine the milk, sugar, eggs, vanilla and almond extract together and blend or process until the batter is smooth just a few pulses up to 20 seconds in total

1. Add the flour, orange zest, and salt and pulse until it’s just incorporated, 5-7 pulses max

1. Pour the batter into the pie pan and quickly top evenly with the fruit.

1. Bake for approx. 45-50 minutes or until set, puffed, and edges are golden brown.

1. Cool the pie plate on a cooling rack for 10-15 minutes (like a Dutch baby the clafoutis will deflate and that is fine) then slice into wedges like a pie or scoop out pieces and serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or with a dollop of whip cream as well
