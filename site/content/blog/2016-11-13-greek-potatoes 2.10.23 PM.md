excerpt: "<p>Not your average potato salad</p>"

Yes we have a potato salad too. Some may argue that it's like an imitation French potato salad. They do have their similarities but I wouldn't call them identical. They both are prepared warm and can be served warm or cold and they share some of the same elements of flavour.  What they also share is how delicious they both are.  
<br>

I truly can't remember ever having a bad potato salad.  Even if it's heavily 'mayonaised' with canned peas &mdash; they all seem to have their charm. There are two types that I make often and are my go- to potato salads.  One of them is a crispy bacon creamy potato salad which I will post on another side Sunday and the second is this Greek style potato salad. My husband requests both all the time especially the bacon one.

This salad is a nice change to the heavier creamier potato salads out there. I love those too don't get me wrong, but if you want a bit of a change this is it. This potato salad has more of a fresh and tangy flavour with its fresh herbs and lemony/vinegary dressing. Those are my kind of flavours. (no wonder I love dill pickle and salt and vinegar chips) They fall into what my husband calls the 'Greek trinity' of flavours: lemon, oregano and olive oil.  I think our flavours expand further than that but those three are definitely staples in many dressings and recipes and including this one for the most part.

I love to eat this potato salad hot and cold the day after it's been sitting in the fridge when the flavours have fully infused the potatoes.  I also love adding feta to mine too but thats totally optional. (How did feta not make the cut for the 'Greek trinity of flavours'? - hmmmmm. must be because it's a stand alone, since we Greeks like to add to and serve it with everything).   I also love bringing these to a potluck or a picnic.  They have no dairy or mayo so they can sit out a little longer being unaffected ( no food poisoning or salmonella poisoning yay!!!).  Everyone can enjoy them too because they are gluten free and vegan if you have family or friends with food sensitivities.

Here it is then. The recipe to this refreshingly delicious Greek style potato salad:

Serves 4-6 as a side (or 1 if your greedy like me)
<br><br>

### Ingredients:

* 5-7 medium sized potatoes pealed and chopped in half and then quartered
* 1 small bunch of chive or green parts of green onions/scallions
* 1 small bunch of parsley
* 1 small bunch of dill(I have seen some recipes call for adding a little mint too but I like the simplicity of the dill and parsley flavours)
* 1/2 of a small onion sliced finely lengthwise(can use this alone or chive alone or both- I like a little bit of both)
* 1/2 a tsp of dry oregano (optional)
* 2-4 tbsp or more of EVOO
* Juice of 1/2 to a whole lemon or 2-3 tbsp of vinegar white or red wine vinegar (I always prefer lemon juice but it's still delicious with the vinegar if you don't have lemons on hand and I always use the whole lemon or a little extra vinegar because I like the tartness of it)
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Directions:

1. Place the potatoes in a large pot and fill with cold water until the potatoes are completely submerged.  Bring water to boil and salt the water very generously- simmer until fork tender

2. While potatoes are boiling chop up all your fresh herbs and onions and place in a bowl along with your lemon juice or vinegar (oregano too if using).

3. Once potatoes are ready, drain and place right into the bowl with the herbs. Delicately mix well and start drizzling in your olive oil.  

4. Add your salt and pepper to taste

5. Serve and enjoy warm or let cool and serve cold.  Either way they are delicious!!

Note: I add the olive oil later because I find when I have placed it in the bowl before hand the potatoes absorb all of if like a sponge and I have to add a lot more of it.  This may still happen but I find when I add it after it takes a lot less oil. Maybe it has something to do with it absorbing the lemon juice first or maybe it's just my imagination!?!? Either way you may need to add a little extra olive oil to get the achieved texture (being not dry)
