This time of year begins the food and holiday frenzy. Searching for sides and new ways to brine things, exciting new pie flavours and much much more.  So I’m adding a side that I think you must try. This is a great fall side that is really easy to whip up and has a nice little kick to it too.

I make this all year round since pumpkin is grown all year here and it’s a nice variety that we have. It’s naturally on the sweeter side and quite delicious.

This dish heightens the natural sweetness of it not only because you’re adding the honey but also because it’s roasted. Roasting pumpkin &ndash; which I do whenever I’m using it for soups, purée or anything like that, makes it hands-down more delicious.  It becomes sweeter, nuttier and caramelises naturally when roasting.  No better way to eat it or prep it for some other use. This is great as a side but can be an entire meal if you ask me.  I love to add some greens and it becomes a salad too.

If you prefer maple syrup or brown sugar instead of the honey feel free to replace it with either of those options. I also like using walnuts and almonds in place of the pecans but pecans are what I had on hand when I originally made this.  Just make sure to use nuts that can stand up to some heat otherwise they will burn. Or you can add them towards the end of the roasting time.

The feta and an extra drizzle of honey makes this pumpkin dish over the top.  Adding the saltiness from the feta and extra sweetness from the honey is just too perfect! We loved this side and hope you do to!!

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400 &deg; F

1. Place everything on a baking sheet without overcrowding &ndash; use two if needed

1. Roast for approx 20-25 minutes or until pumpkin is cooked through and has nice and golden brown edges. I like to toss halfway through roasting
