It feels like I haven't blogged in so long but it's only been a few days.  Those few days were packed with so much activity though.  Work has been busy, life has been busy and just about everything else.  Today was a day I was looking forward to for a long time.  My first Saturday morning off in months! I was so excited I could barely sleep and was running on hyper-mode adrenaline all day and a lot of caffeine!  I had a doctors appt first thing but my husband and I decided to use this day to celebrate our anniversary which is actually in a couple of weeks so we decided to go have a nice little breakfast after my appointment and after that, I treated myself to a pedicure.  It's been since about 2014 that I had a pro pedicure and it felt so good I wanted to cry (sleep deprivation has me emotional over everything)! I'm usually way too cheap and too busy to sit for an hour or longer to let someone do what I can do, and do for myself.  That doesn't sound right but I think you get what I mean. My husband insisted though, and I'm super glad he did! My feet look soo pretty!

That's all for the personal sharing let's get down to this recipe.  I love to do quick and easy seafood recipes.  First, cause as I mentioned they are quick. They don't need lots of time marinating and they cook quickly as well. Secondly, they are also super delicious and as for salmon itself - it's full of high-quality protein, vitamins, minerals and lots of omega-3's which is super awesome for mood stabilization, and a healthy nervous system. The list goes on with salmon.  That's why I chose it for this bowl beside the fact that I also love it.

The sesame buckwheat soba noodles are one of my favourites. I totally love the texture and taste of soba noodles and they are also a good source of protein, fibre, iron, and carbohydrates. They are also gluten free if you have issues with gluten. They are full of veggies and if you have never cooked soba before they are super quick to cook - like minutes. So everything in this bowl comes together quickly. One thing I wanted to mention is that you can have this noodle recipe cold as a salad or hot as I have described below. I prefer them stir fried a bit and hot. I love how all the flavours come together that way, but having them as a salad also works and the veggies are nice and crunchy in the cold salad version. Feel free to add other things to the sesame noodles like mushrooms or even some edamame would be wonderful.  I literally can eat the noodles as a full meal on their own. So delicious!

I love adding bean sprouts or shoots in this case alfalfa because I think they are delicious with any Asian inspired flavours.  They belong together in my brain.  They are also packed with concentrated amounts of vitamins and minerals, and I love the little crunch they add, so feel free to pack on as much as you want into that bowl of yours.

This is the third week of meal prep and planning that I'm doing with the [@thetrainingpad](https://www.instagram.com/trainingpad) and I'm totally loving it.  So fun creating some quick and easy plus nourishing bowls that are great for people just like me &mdash; busy but still health conscience and people who want to eat well and eat deliciously.  It's easy to get stuck in a rut when you're meal prepping, so I really hope that these bowls have given you a little meal prep-spiration! Follow us along as we have one more week of collaboration. Next week's will also be delicious and can't wait to share it. It's a vegetarian bowl and is going to be so awesome!!! Stay tuned!

## For the salmon

Serves 4
<br>

### Ingredients

* 8 wooden skewers soaked in water for a 30 minutes before grilling
* 4 boneless skinless salmon fillets sliced or cut in chunks (cut while still slightly frozen or place in the freezer for 10-15 min to freeze the fillets slightly which will make slicing easier)
* ⅓ cup Tamari or soy sauce
* ¼ cup honey
* 3 tbsp rice wine or rice vinegar
* 1 tbsp of grated Ginger
* 1 clove of garlic grated
* Zest and juice of one small lime

### Directions

1. Heat the grill to medium and grease the grates with a little vegetable oil
2. In a small bowl whisk together the honey, tamari or soy sauce, rice vinegar, ginger and garlic and marinate the chunks or slices of salmon for approx 10 minutes (I reserve a couple of tbsp of the marinade in a separate bowl prior to marinating, to baste the fish while on the grill but that is optional)
3. Thread the salmon pieces onto the skewers and grill until done and edges start to have a nice char to them, turning them occasionally (takes 8-10 minutes or less depending on how large your pieces are).  You can alternatively keep the salmon as a filet and marinate as called for but pan fry the fillets in a skillet if you don't have a grill or grill pan.
4. Remove from grill when done and serve immediately with the noodles

## For the sesame soba noodles

* 1 package of buckwheat soba noodles 12.8oz cooked according to package directions and then set aside
* 3 tbsp of olive oil
* 3 cloves garlic minced
* 1 tbsp chopped Ginger
* 1½ cups of carrots cut into thin matchsticks
* 1½ cups of sweet peppers (I used red and yellow pimentos but you can use any kind) sliced finely
* 1 cup of snow peas trimmed and washed
* 1 onion sliced finely
* 3 Tsp​ sesame oil
* &frac14; cup honey
* ¼ cup tamari or soy sauce
* 2 tbsp rice vinegar
* 1 small bunch of chives or scallions very thinly chopped
* 2 tbsp sesame seeds
* 1 cup of bean sprouts

### Directions

1. In a small bowl combine and whisk together the sesame oil, honey, tamari or soy sauce, and rice vinegar and set aside
2. In a large-sized​ skillet or wok heat the olive oil to a medium heat and stir fry the onion, garlic, Ginger, carrots, peppers and snow peas for approx 4 minutes
3. Add the soba noodles and toss while adding in the sauce a tbsp at a time until everything is well coated. Taste and adjust the ​amount of tamari or soy sauce and sesame oil to your liking.
4. Plate and top with sliced scallions and sesame seeds, top with 2 salmon skewers and a handful of sprouts
