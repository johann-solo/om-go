excerpt: "<p>The tastiest meatballs and marinara sauce made the Italian way</p>"
---

Like many people I am a huge fan of pasta (even gluten free). I can eat it with anything and everything or even plain or for a quick bite-buttered, tossed with fresh tomatoes, feta and drizzled with olive oil and with a lot of cracked black pepper on it.  Mmmmm! Yum! But add meat and a good sauce and it's a whole new level of love!

I grew up in an area with a lot of Italians. I mean a lot. The place was called Stoney Creek but often referred to by its nickname Tony's Creek &mdash; an ode to how many Italians live there (or lived there &mdash; I heard the demographic has changed quite a bit). I have a lot of dear Italian friends that really feel like family to me.  Although the food may have its differences the Italian culture is very similar to Greek culture so really all my friends felt like an extension of my family.

Walking into their homes was always an experience for the senses. Aromas of food either cooking or having been cooked. You can either appreciate that or not. A friend of mine said every time she walked into her mother in laws house its smelled like stale tomatoes. To some that might be a negative. But I on the other hand know the smell and love it.  The smell of fresh tomato sauce bubbling.  It's strong and it lingers that's for sure, but always makes me think of really good sauce and then all the good stuff the sauce is used for.

My friend's mom would make the best arancini or rice balls I have ever had. I had another friend who would make an out of this world tender veal in a fantastic marinara. Just perfection! I can go on about all the amazing food my friends and their mother's make.  I have lots of favorites. Like who's mom made the best pizzelle, the best anginetti, the best pesche dolci, the best pasta etc.... the list of this amazing food can go on and on.
<br>

But I will keep things simple with an easy marinara that you can make at home instead of using the store bought. It's perfect for any of your sauce needs. Whether it's just for your pasta, meatballs, lasagna, or anything else you would use a marinara for. You can make it ahead like the day before and just heat it up when you need. I do a big batch when I'm making lasagna and keep some extra for shakshuka or for a cacciatore, or chicken or eggplant parm.

The meatballs are super flavorful and so nice fork tender. I love them.  My friend is married to an Italian and she ate my meatballs once and asked " how do you get your meatballs to taste so Italian?" Well the answer is ask an Italian how they make their meatballs and follow suit! This is a very basic meatball recipe.  It's also a very flexible one too.  The ratio of bread and breadcrumbs can be altered to taste.  Some people don't like adding the Parmesan cheese to them and that is fine. And you can play up the herbs a little too.  You could also add a third meat like many do. Often added is ground veal. So feel free to add it in or even do all ground beef if you don't have the pork. This is the way I like mine.  You could change and add things to your personal taste.  Hope you live these as much as my husband and I do! Let me know what you add to your meatballs and sauce!

## Homemade marinara sauce

### Ingredients

* 1/4-1/2 cup olive oil

* 1 large onion chopped finely

* 3 cloves garlic chopped finely

* 2 carrots chopped finely

* 2 stalks celery chopped finely

* 1/2-1 red sweet bell pepper chopped

* 1 bay leaf

* Salt and pepper to taste

* 2 cans crushed tomatoes (or diced if you don't have crushed- with a tbsp of tomato paste if using diced)

* 1 cup plus extra of chicken broth or water

* 1 small bunch of basil chopped and stirred in after blending (optional)


### Directions

1. Heat a medium sized pot to medium high heat and add the olive oil and all the onions and sauté until translucent

1. Add the garlic and sauté for a minute until fragrant and the rest of the veggies and sauté for 5-10 min until they are soft.  

1. Add your tomatoes and broth or water and bring to a boil then turn down heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. Stir occasionally and check to see if it needs more broth or water.   

1. Once done you can check for seasoning and add more salt and pepper if needed.  You can leave the sauce chunky like it is or I like to use my immersion blender and smooth it out a bit.  Up to your personal taste.

1. Gently place the meatballs in the sauce and gently simmer for 20-30 min occasionally and carefully stirring.
