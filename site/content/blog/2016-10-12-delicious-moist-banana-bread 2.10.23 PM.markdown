Have you ever searched 'Best Banana Bread' on Pinterest or google? There's literally hundreds and even possibly thousands of recipes that claim they are the best. The takes on banana bread are so varied. Nuts, no nuts. Chocolate chips, no chips. Butter no butter but instead oil or vice versa.  Gluten free, vegan, paleo, pumpkin and the list goes on and on and on! I have tried many different recipes.  The only ones I haven't tried are vegan or gluten free, so I can't say anything about that category yet. I will have to experiment with those recipes soon though.

I think banana bread is one of those foods that people have different opinions on.  For example I brought this particular bread to work one day and of course almost everyone raved about it (because it's such a yummy recipe) except one person who took one look at it and said "that looks over done".  She was use to box banana bread/ muffin mix which is like yellow box cake with flecks.  She had never had this kind of banana bread; a banana bread made from scratch. Once she knew the difference she agreed to have some and enjoyed it, but to her the best banana bread came from a box. Is she wrong? Absolutely not in her mind and her taste.  I'm not going to be judge of tastes, but you get the point.  Everyone's taste for banana bread and what they consider good banana bread is different.

Here is why I think this one is the best banana bread recipe I have tried thus far:

* The base recipe always turns out perfect and the same every time
* The original recipe called for pecans but its a versatile recipe and I have switched the pecans out to walnuts and added chocolate chips on occasion
* It always turns out perfectly moist
* It's not too sweet
* Every time someone tries it they must have the recipe. (A very good sign)
* Recipe uses basic pantry ingredients which is always such a bonus

The [original recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/banana-bread-with-pecans-recipe.html) is from the food network by Tyler Florence.  I adapted it because I find the part of that recipe that says to separate the 4 bananas and prepare in two batches doesn't work for me.  The consistency doesn't come out the way I like it so I don't separate the bananas.  I blend all four together as you see in the recipe [here on the blog](http://oliveandmango.com/banana-bread-with-pecans). I also almost always add chocolate chips.  I love the crunch from the pecans or walnuts if your swapping, and the little surprise crunch and burst of sweetness when you bite into a chocolate chip.
Definitely feel free to try the recipe on the food network website and compare for yourself.
In the meantime I hope you enjoy this recipe which is my favourite banana bread recipe. A classic and a favourite of anyone I have made it for too.  Can't beat that right!
Let me know if you have a favourite recipe for this classic.  I would love to know and I'm always willing to try other recipes for it.
