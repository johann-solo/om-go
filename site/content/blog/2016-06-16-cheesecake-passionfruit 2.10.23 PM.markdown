I love cheesecake - but then again so do most people. Creamy rich filling with a crisp crust &mdash; a perfect ratio of fat and sugar. However, I’m not too keen on the traditional toppings of cherries or blueberries though. I must admit that I usual scrape a lot of it to the side to get to the good stuff (sorry, I know).

But this little tweak proves to be a winner. Joanne had some passion fruit given to her by a friend and decided to give it a try. **It was a hit**. With just the right amount of fruit, it turned out to be a refreshing glaze. The citrus element made it feel deceptively lighter than it was.

I brought a slice to work and some of my coworkers went nuts. I literally had people asking for orders. We may consider it, but in the meantime I don’t mind being the beneficiary of Joanne’s culinary experiments.

So now that you've had the hubby's take on this recipe, let me fill you in on the recipe itself. I have posted the Juniors Famous Cheesecake recipe on the blog as my go to recipe for my cheesecakes but it's actually adapted. I have never done the crust from their recipe because I personally love the classic graham cracker crust. I love a thicker crust and I like it kind of coming up the side of the cake a little. That is just personal taste, so feel free to adjust measurements when making crust to your liking.  
<br>

Now a few things to consider about the crust. It's not always easy to find graham crackers or prepackaged crumbled crackers here in Trinidad. Although we do have an amazing pre-packaged one made here locally which is delicious and I use it all the time if it's available. But if it's not, I simply use digestive crackers or cookies and adjust or omit the amount of sugar according to taste and I grind them down in my food processor. Otherwise you can put them in a sealed plastic bag and pound them out or roll with a rolling pin until fine and until you have enough.

I make the filling the same exact way every time. There's no need to make any changes - it's perfection every time!! I always bake it in a water bath. I also always leave it to cool for at least an hour before refrigerating it, and I refrigerate for at least a couple of hours before I top it.
<br><br>

Side tip about about the water bath: I have never been able to avoid water or what I originally thought was water from seeping through the five layers of foil that I would wrap my spring-form pan in. Well according to some super smart Youtube clip about making the perfect cheesecake, that is not water seeping in. Duh!!!! It's condensation and literally unavoidable **unless** (they had the best and smartest solution!!!!!!!!) you place your spring-form pan in a baking dish that's just slightly bigger than your spring form and then place it in the water bath!!! And cue the sound of the heavens opening up and *aahhhh*. Simple and yet a genius way to keep the moisture from condensation to a bare minimum if any.

For the topping I usually go with basic cherry and blueberry which I think is classic and delicious. (sorry Johann) I use the canned pie filling most of the time because fresh blueberries and cherries are not always easy to find or available in Trinidad. I also choose canned pie fillings that have no added sugars or preservatives. But when I get my hands on some passionfruit I use that as the topping and use the recipe below:

(Adpated from Junior's Famous Cheesecake recipe)
<br><br>

### Ingredients for the crust
* 1 and 1/2 cups of finely ground graham cracker crumbs or more depending on how thick you like the crust and if you like it coming up the side of the pan

* 1/4 to 1/3 cup of sugar or none depending on how sweet you like the crust

* 6 tablespoons butter, melted more or less depending on how much graham cracker crust you have

* 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon (optional). I don't add it if I'm using digestive biscuits

**Directions**

1. mix all, ingredients until well blended and then press mixture into pan 8-10 inch or smaller if you like a thicker crust

1. Bake at 375&deg;F for 7 min ( a few min longer if your making a thicker crust) and let chill while you finish making filling

<br><br>

### Ingredients for the topping
* 1/2 cup of passionfruit pulp

* 1tbsp cornflour/starch

* 100ml water

* 1/2 cup caster sugar

**Directions**

1. Once your cheesecake is set, you can make the topping by combining the cornflour and water in a small pot and stirring until smooth over a medium heat.

1. Add the passion fruit and sugar and continue to cook for 5 or so minutes while it boils and thickens.

1. Allow to cool slightly before pouring onto the cake and returning to the fridge for at least an hour to set.
