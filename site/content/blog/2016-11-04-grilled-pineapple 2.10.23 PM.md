Just sitting in Starbucks after a very long and tiring day of work writing this post. This Starbucks branch has only been open for a couple weeks. One of two in Trinidad by the way (for now anyway).  We decided to come and do some work here just for a change of scenery.  "Kind of like a date night", my husband said.  Yes I thought, one that will include us not speaking to each other for at least an hour while we type and sip.  My idea of a perfect "date night". Cue sarcasm. But it was good to get out of the house nonetheless.
<br><br>

I sit here and I have to say it feels very weird.  Feels like an unfamiliar Starbucks because it's new, but also feels as though when I walk out of it I will be somewhere in Scarborough, Ontario.  Its a bit trippy! But all the same I'm happy to be at this one because when I walk out the door I will be welcomed by a warm breeze.  Speaking of trippy, holy 'tripsters' (definition: Trini-hipsters) at this Starbucks.  Note to self &mdash; dress better when you go to Starbucks Movietowne.

I digress completely though.  Now down to business. These beautiful and succulent grilled shrimp and pineapple skewers.I asked all my beloved IG followers last week or the week before (tired brain problems) what I should do with a huge delicious pineapple I got from the market.  I got some amazing responses that I actually can't wait to try.  If you didn't see it here are some that were mentioned:

* grilled with cinnamon and sugar
* cake (which made me think of an amazing cake my mom use to make with fresh cream and custard, almonds and pineapple.... she can't find the recipe though &mdash; tears)
* grilled with maple syrup and then made into a salsa over fish
* make it with ham
* grilled or in a smoothie
* baked with lamb
* pine slaw
* pine chow
<br>

Love them all! Did you notice a bit of a theme though? Grilled definitely won over this one but I have those other ones stored.  I'm especially intrigued with the baked pineapple with lamb.  Need to find a proper recipe for that one.  And I am definitely on a mission to locate that cake recipe too!!
<br><br>

I decided to do it grilled and hadn't had shrimp in a while and thought I should do it with shrimp and a teriyaki kind of sauce/marinade for them. It turned out delicious! I didn't quite marinade the shrimp as long as I probably should have but they were still great and very flavorful. I mean you can never go wrong with garlic and ginger. Ok I obviously can ramble on  tonight so I will stop now and give you the easy-peasy recipe

## Grilled pineapple and shrimp skewers

### Ingredients
Marinade (a basic homemade teriyaki sauce)

* 2 tbsp maple syrup or honey
* 1/4 cup soy sauce of your choice
* 4 tbsp of coconut sugar or brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp of minced ginger
* 1/2 tsp of minced garlic
* 2-3 stems of chive/ green onion
* 1 fragrant fresh pineapple cut up into chunks or 1 can of pineapple chunks
* 1/2-1 lb. of shrimp depending on size of them and the pineapple your using and how many your serving (peeled and deveined)
* wooden skewers
* a small bunch of cilantro or chadon beni chopped to garnish

### Directions:
1. Combine ingredients for marinade in a dish or plastic ziplock bag, place shrimp in marinade and toss to coat. Cover and marinate in the fridge for as little as a half hour to as much as 2 hours (I make two batches of the teriyaki sauce recipe and use the second batch to make sauce for the skewers.  This is totally optional but I like having some extra sauce.  For the sauce though I toss all the ingredients in a small sauce pan and let it simmer and thicken for a couple minutes. If it's not thickening (like mine because i used maple syrup or your also impatient like me) then add cornstarch slurry to thicken
2. In the meantime soak your wooden skewers and chop up pineapple and set aside
3. After marinating, stack your skewers with the pineapple and shrimp alternating or in whatever pattern you desire.
4. Coat a hot grill with a bit of oil and "put the shrimp on the barbie". They don't take long to cook 2-5 min per side.
5. Serve while they are hot with the sauce and garnished with chadon beni. I like to serve them over veggie fried rice and garlic pak choi. Enjoy!
