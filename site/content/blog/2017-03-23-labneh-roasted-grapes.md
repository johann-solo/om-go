Labneh is a rich and tangy strained yoghurt which if left to thicken long enough becomes more of a spreadable yoghurt cheese.  It's commonly associated and paired with middle eastern dishes like grilled meats, salads and spicy dishes. I think it's texture is like a thicker creamier Greek yoghurt.

I totally love it! It's delicious and I would use the same process in making a thick style tzatziki  but I also love it with granola and honey, on toast like I have pictured here and I also like it made into a dip. It's so basic and easy to make you literally just have to strain yoghurt to make it.  There is labneh available to buy here in Trinidad as we have a fairly large middle eastern community but it can be costly. This is a great alternative to store-bought labneh. There's a local yoghurt  brand I use that is homemade and plain and I use it to make a beautifully thick and creamy spreadable labneh. But you can use any yoghurt and that's what gave me the idea to use the goat yoghurt by another awesome local company Amare probiotics. It turned out fabulous!

You can get various thicknesses of labneh by straining it. The longer it sits straining the thicker the labneh you will get. I personally like it creamy, thick and spreadable. So to achieve that you need to strain your yoghurt for approx. 8-12 hours.  Why the window? Well because each yoghurt you buy may vary in water content so it really depends on the yoghurt.  If you are using a Greek style yoghurt you probably need less time but a thinner runnier one may need more time straining. If you are straining it for more than that, say 24-48hours you will get an even thicker spreadable cheese like a a softer cream cheese, longer than that will get you a firmer cheese with a  mozzarella'ish texture only softer.

I love goat cheese and goat cheese paired with sweet preserves and jams is so darn good.  I was inspired by IG and a lot of people on it roasting there grapes and I wanted to give it a try. I love grapes and it's crazy that I never thought to roast them before this day. Anyways roasting them is a very very good decision. If you have been following my IG stories you would know I made these a little while back. When I made them originally and posted the video on stories one of my friends saw it and made them the same day.  She said her and her husband loved them and that her hubby thought they would be great over icecream and she thought they would be perfect on her salad.  So these roasted grapes are just divine anyway you eat them and decide on using them.  This combo was superb!! But I will definitely mix it up and use my homemade labneh recipe for many more things and enjoy my roasted grapes alone or even try them on my salads!!
<br>

Hope you try them both out and let me know how it goes.  Also if you have any killer combos with either I would love to here about it!
