excerpt: This chocolate olive oil cake has an intense, rich flavour and can easily be made fully vegan

Want something very rich and chocolatey? You have come to the right place! This cake delivers in so many ways and the actual cake itself is vegan, so it’s perfect for all those in your  life that are vegan.  For me it’s my mother in law, so I’m always looking out for recipes that she might be interested in or ones I may want to make for her when she visits. It’s not often that I get to cook for her but still once you have someone vegan in your life, vegan recipes always seem to catch your eye.  This is also a vegan recipe that doesn’t require flax eggs or any such substitutions. It’s a basic pantry ingredient recipe that you can literally make in one bowl.

The frosting or icing whatever you would like to call it is not vegan though.  I adapted the recipe from smittenkitchen and Deb uses a glaze for the topping but I wanted something a little lighter and frothy so I did a mascarpone one that is pretty perfect for this cake. Think McCain deep and delicious cake. The cake is moist with a nice crumble and very rich and decadent tasting. The chocolate is intense and made richer with the addition of coffee which I opted to add in mine instead of water as the original recipe called for.  For a vegan glaze just simply make one as she does with cocoa powder, olive oil and sweetener of choice &ndash; like maple syrup.

I love olive oil cakes and this one did not disappoint. I’m always impressed by their texture and love how rich they are. This one is just that and more. What made it a home run for me was the ease, and also the simple ingredients involved.  Quick and easy cake that will be one of many staple recipes I use and pull out. I’m sure you will enjoy it!
