Working out and the gym. I don't know what feelings those two drum up. For most it's an "ugh" and a big old sigh! I'm kind of in between both. I love it when I do it, but if I haven't gone in a while I feel guilty about it but at the same time lack the motivation to get back at it.
<br><br>

I have had gym memberships in the past, worked at a gym through school and loved going to the one close to home cause I got to see my friends, studied while on the elliptical, stairclimber and bike and it was perfect for those winter months. But I hated all the prep especially if I was going before or after work. Pack clothes, sneakers, snack, shower stuff (if I was going before work). The list goes on.

The last several years I have been sans gym membership, probably for over 5 years now.  I used to run (correction more like a jog) quite a bit before I moved to Trinidad.  It was my favorite thing to do, and best thing for clearing the head and getting good sleep and having more energy overall.  Loved signing up to do 5K and 10k runs because they kept me motivated to run and keep active.  
<br>

Well things are a little different here.  It is very hot, like very hot, and humid here and I find it really hard to maintain my running.  Although I still do it if I'm out on an early run before the sun is out and blasting — which is a rarity because I have to go to work around that time. I do still enjoy a jog in the evenings around the Savannah, hikes or going up Lady Chancellor or Hololo which are two hills in the area that are popular to walk or run up for exercise.  I love doing this when I have the time. You need at least an hour if not more for these. I don't always have that kind of time in the evenings.

As for the gym, well I have been over it for a long time.  Don't get me wrong.  If you gave me a free membership I would take it.  But to pay for one and then have to worry about parking, waiting for machines, going off peak hours — not my kinda thing. So the last few years I have been doing things at home. I used to have a rebounder which I loved, but gave away before we moved here. So now I do a lot of workout videos on YouTube, follow some noteworthy Instagram accounts and get a lot of ideas and inspiration for all sorts of workouts that you can do in the privacy of your own home, at your convenience and the best part is that with many of them, it's almost like you have an instructor right there with you.

Did I mention it's free too! (except internet provider costs of course, in case someone argues that) Not only do I get  a great workout but I also get safe stretching exercises, lessons on proper form, tips on diet and nutrition, and also a good variety so I never feel bored. It's perfect for busy people like most of us and especially moms who have very little time for themselves.
<br><br>

Here are a list of a few that I absolutely love and do all the time plus some accounts that I follow and deets on why I follow them:
<br><br>

**Ballet beautiful exercises by Mary Helen Bowers — YouTube.**
<br>
This woman is quite amazing. I sometimes end up sitting on my mat and just staring at her do her thing.  She is captivating to watch move and flex. Other than that she has some kick butt videos and one of my favorites of hers that I feel for days and days after is the ‘Lean legs and buns’ video.   I'm usually cursing her silently by the end of it but it's an excellent and challenging mat workout. Another bonus is they are all pretty short so you can squeeze them in when you have a few minutes to do them.  You don't need anything besides a mat to do these exercises so it's super low maintenance.
<br><br>

**Sugary six pack  — YouTube.**
<br>
Niki is a total fire cracker.  I love this girl!  She is a total athlete and it shows.
I do her videos on YouTube and follow her on IG (Instagram) as well [@sugarysixpack](https://www.instagram.com/sugarysixpack).  Her Instagram is awesome. It has great little workouts in general and even some you can do if your traveling, using a chair, couch and etc.  Her YouTube videos are great! They are short and you will definitely be sweating or dying like me after them.  Just a little FYI though, a lot of her workouts are high impact.  They have a lot of jumping in them especially the cardio blasts.  Just mentioning this in case you may have knee issues, but she does have some great mat exercises for abs.  You don't need much other than a mat, skipping rope (although I air skip due to the lack of space in my apartment for skipping with an actual rope)  and a couple of weights which I often don't include because for a lot of the workouts I haven't worked up to the fitness level of using the weight. So technically it's optional.  My fave is the 14 minute trim thighs video and love all her cardio blasts.

**Carmen Morgan [@mytrainercarmen](https://www.instagram.com/mytrainercarmen) — Instagram.**
<br>
Her IG account is amazing.  Her physic is incredible! She has great exercises and I love her mobility flow posts which include stretches for better mobility.  She is also great about showing you the right and wrong way of doing exercises which I love!
<br><br>

**[@trainingpad](https://www.instagram.com/trainingpad)  — Instagram.**
<br>
Fantastic couple team also with exceptional physics! They have some fantastic advice not only on training and exercises but also on diet and nutrition and motivation on reaching fitness goals and potential.  They offer private training, boot camps, nutritional plans and even online coaching.  
<br>

There's also another Carmen in my life and that is **[@carmelapilates](https://www.instagram.com/carmelapilates) - Instagram.**
<br>
I know her personally and love her with all my heart and soul.  She is a certified Pilates instructor, mom and wifey.  Her IG account is not just a window into her colorful personality and life but also offers some great nutrition advice, stretching and foam roller exercises and some fantastic motivational content.  She's one of few that has seen and she knows my colorful side. We share a lot in common including dental craziness. That just adds to why I love her and why she is very inspirational to me and my creative side.
<br><br>

Lastly but not least is **[@jbpilatestt](https://www.instagram.com/jbpilatestt)  — Instagram.**
<br>
John is not only a personal and dear friend but a Pilates lover through and through.  Follow his journey in becoming a certified instructor, some motivational quotes as well as tips on form and fitness he's learned on the way as well as from his many years of experience taking Pilates by the well known and reputable **[@madeleinepilates](https://www.instagram.com/madeleinepilates)**.  So proud of him and what he's accomplished and excited about where this will take him.
