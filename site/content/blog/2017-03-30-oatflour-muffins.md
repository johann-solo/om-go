It's a holiday today! How exciting! What do you like to do on a holiday? My dream day would be get up late have a great cup of coffee and then go to the beach all day with a good book. Eat beach food (shark and bake and have a couple of brewsky's) and then come home rested with beach hair to a clean house. It's called a dream day because that is soo not reality!! If I woke up late and decided to go to the beach here on a holiday I would be stuck in traffic getting there and then it would be nightmare to find parking and a decent spot on the beach.

So instead I'm happy with my usual holiday day.  I wake up early as usual, do my volunteer work, do some blog work, do an excursion of sort that doesn't involve the beach (today it will be a little hike to Mt St Benedict) then come home and clean, organise my closet, cook and then enjoy a relaxing evening. Well at least that's the plan! I usually feel super content getting things done that I usually don't have time to do during the week like organise the closet.  I usually pick one household duty like that each holiday or day off I may have.  So it's either the closet, the pantry, or any drawer. It's totally cathartic and I have a need for it.

That doesn't happen all the time.  If we want a beach day we get up early and go as early as we can get our butts in gear on a holiday (so like 7) beat traffic and leave early before the rush back. Still an enjoyable day but it's good to switch it up, and a little hike is a perfect way to do it.  So I'm excited about it and hope to share a pic or two with you guys on my stories!

Now to these oatmeal muffins!! These have saved my mornings. I love making them. They are easy and great to take for snacks (on like say a hike), a to-go breakfast or for anytime.  The best part is that you can add what you like to them once you have your base. This is my favourite combo because I'm a nut and chocolate lover but they would be great with cranberries, raisins and whatever nut or seed you love!
