It's been a really nice weekend. Busy but which weekend isn't, right? We had a few friends over for a little wine and cheese last night and we had such a nice time.  Loved it! But what's better than food and wine shared with friends?!?! I can't wait to share some pics of the charcuterie from the evening and some tips on making a very simple one and some easy recipes I include when I'm having a wine and cheese party. I look forward to sharing!

Today is a bit of a slower day for me.  I had a really busy week and weekend so far and I know I need  some recovery time so today was a little slow.  I did a little cooking and stories but the rest of the time was just in bed immersed in a good read and of course a little Netflix therapy. We are a little addicted to Designated Survivor. Anyone else watching it? I have learned that if I don't have a little downtime I will just crash and will be out of commission for a few days.  But my schedule doesn't allow for that so gotta have a little down time to be ready for the week ahead. A little rest goes a long way. I have a lot of things to put away from last nights wine and cheese and today's cooking but it will have to wait. The important thing is that's it's all clean and I can get to it tomorrow. Sometimes you just gotta let it go!  

> the perfect blend of fats, sweetness, saltiness and crunch

My side this week is the perfect blend of fats, sweetness, saltiness and crunch. I love all  those components. It takes a few steps to make but it's so worth it.  I don't think there's a vegetable I have yet to encounter that I hate but I do know brussel sprouts are up there on the list of hated veggies by many. Haters may become converts though, after having them this way. Brussels sprouts just go perfectly with bacon. They were made for each other!! By caramelising the pecans and bacon you add the sweet, salty and crunchiness to the perfectly roasted sprouts. Couldn't get enough of these and I'm sure you will feel the same way about them. Enjoy!
Just a little note.  I have used frozen ones before too.  I have steamed them, allowed them to dry of excess water and then used them as if fresh.  They cook a little faster so you may have to adjust how long to cook them based on that.

## Roasted brussel sprouts with candied pecans and bacon
<br>

### Ingredients

* 1 large onion red or yellow
* 250 gram package of bacon sliced
* 450 grams of brussel sprouts washed, ends trimmed if needed and sliced in half
* 2 cloves garlic roughly chopped
* 1-2 cup of pecans
* 2-3 tbsp of maple syrup
* 2 tbsp of brown sugar
* Salt and pepper to your liking
* 2 tbsp of butter plus 2 more for toasting the pecans
* 1-2 tbsp of fat rendered from frying the bacon
<br>

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425

1. In an oven proof pan on medium heat fry up the bacon until well done and then remove with tongs and place on a plate lined with a paper towel and set aside to allow to cool

1. In the same pan remove most of the bacon fat except for approximately 1-2 tbsp and, add 2 tbsp of butter and heat pan at medium/ high heat (if its not oven safe transfer oil into an oven safe pan)

1. Add the onions and sauté for a minute to soften slightly

1. Add the brussel sprouts and sauté for another couple minutes until they start to soften.  Add the garlic, toss and put into the oven to roast for 15 minutes or until golden, tossing once halfway through.

1. While the sprouts are roasting, In a medium pan toast pecans at medium/low heat until fragrant and darkened tossing and stirring them in the pan often so they do not burn. Once done remove from pan and set aside. Heat butter in pan until melted and return pecans into pan and toss to coat them with butter. Pour in maple syrup and sugar and stir well and continuously while syrup and sugar bubble away. Turn heat down if needed, add in the bacon and stir everything until the syrup is almost evaporated. Place them on a cookie sheet or plate, and let them cool and dry

1. Once the brussel sprouts are finished roasting remove from oven carefully (don't burn yourself on the pan handle by accident like I do all the time), plate and toss with the candied bacon and pecans and serve.
