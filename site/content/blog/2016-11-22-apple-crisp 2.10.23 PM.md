This is such a great and easy dessert to feed a crowd.  From young to old everyone loves it.  Everyone except my husband that is.  He doesn't like cooked apples but he loves the crisp topping.  Good thing I like apples so it's a win win. I get to eat more apples and he gets to have his topping and a bit of mine too. Who could blame him for loving that topping though.  It's 'crispy', buttery and sweet!! And that dulce de leche drizzle adds a little extra something to this dessert.  Because caramel and apples go together like PB and jelly.

Having people over is fantastic but can also be stressful. I think so at least, especially if it's a crowd so I opt to cooking things that can be made or prepped ahead of time and this is perfect for that. You can make the filling and topping ahead and keep refrigerated separately and then you can put it together in minutes, put it in the oven and let the house smell of apples and cinnamon as your eating dinner.  Drizzle with that caramel sauce and serve with some good vanilla ice cream! Yum!! It's perfect and totally headache free.  I'm not a pastry genius so I stress a little over pies. How will it turn out this time? Is it flaky enough?...... With this crisp you don't have to even think about that. Comes out perfect every time!

Don't have enough apples? No problem. I have added frozen peaches and nectarines too. It's very versatile so you can play around and be adventurous with what you would like to add to the filling or the topping. You can add your favourite granola to the topping and you can even add some chopped nuts for some extra crunch. With or without the caramel sauce it's a delicious dessert. You can use a store bought sauce as I did (it was a gift) this time, or you can simply make it yourself. What do you like to add into your crisp? Do you have a favourite topping for your crisp?

## Apple crisp with dulce de leche
<br>

### Ingredients:

* 5 lbs of apples (works out to be approx 10 medium apples) of your choice washed, peeled, cored and sliced thinly
* 2 tbsp each of fresh orange juice and lemon juice (I have used all lemon and all orange if you don't have both and it's fine) and a tsp of zest from each as well
* 1/2 cup of coconut sugar (granulated sugar is fine too) -cut back to 1/4 cup if adding the caramel sauce
* 2 tsp of ground cinnamon

* 1 1/2 cups Flour
* 1 cup Rolled oats not quick oats
* 1/2 cup Coconut sugar or granulated
* 1/2 cup Brown sugar
* 1/2 lb. of Butter-very cold and cubed (I cube mine and put it into the freezer while I prepare all dry ingredients)
* 1/2 tsp of salt
<br>

### Topping directions
