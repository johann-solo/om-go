How has everyone's week been going so far?  I had a busy start right from the get go but that is not anything new. Sundays to Tuesdays are literally my busiest days of the week. Once Tuesday is over I feel like I can breathe again!  Tonight I'm doing some organising and tweaking of my blogging schedule and calendar and of course writing this post. You see I should have been doing this while we were on our little two day retreat last week but instead I decided to catch up on sleep on those days.  It was much needed and I don't feel an ounce of guilt. That's why I'm doing it today and through the week.  As I look at my planner and photos I'm realising I have a lot of things to share and I'm exited to do so. There's a few recipes and blog posts pending and coming soon as well as lots of upcoming recipes and photo shoots. Can't wait!  

> this meal takes 30 minutes or less which makes it ideal for a midweek meal.

So now to another great curry that you can add to your midweek meal planning. A very simple recipe that goes really well with the [coconut rice and pigeon peas](http://oliveandmango.com/coconut-rice-peas) I posted the other day. Together with the rice and peas or separate, this meal takes 30 minutes or less which makes it ideal for a midweek meal. I use local Caribbean salmon which is a basic white fish fillet. You can use any white fish you would like to use.  
<br>

Many people season the fish over night or for at least an hour with green seasoning and your welcome too.  I usually season larger cuts of fish more than I would these thin fillets.  So I would say it's optional in this recipe. The reason being is that the sauce is so flavourful already that it really doesn't need extra seasoning. The fish totally absorbed the flavours of the sauce and it's probably because the cut of the fish is so thin. Some dust the fish with a little flour before pan frying but I don't in this recipe
But if you're use to doing that then by all means dredge the fish in a bit of flour before pan frying it.

The sauce is nice and creamy from the coconut milk and super flavourful from the garlic, ginger and of course the curry.  Feel free to use any type of curry you would like. I used a local curry but this would work lovely with a Thai curry as well.  You can even add some turmeric to boost the nutrient levels and add more colour to the dish.  Feel free to add in some potato or even some chickpeas as well to beef it up.  All in all it's a fabulously simple recipe with tons of flavour and a great way to get more fish into your diet!! Hope you all enjoy it!! And hope you have a great week ahead!

A side note. How are you guys finding my IG stories? Are they helpful at all? Would you like to see more of them? I have been toying with the idea of starting a YouTube channel in the near future showcasing my already existing recipes and future ones step by step. Would love your thoughts and also any advice or feedback on that. That's all for now!

## Coconut curry fish
Serves 4
<br>
<br>

### Ingredients

* 1-11/2 lbs of white fish fillets cut In half or in thirds if they are large pieces

* 2 tbsp of <span class="highlight">[green seasoning](http://oliveandmango.com/green-seasoning)</span> plus more if you plan on seasoning your fish in advance (see note at the bottom for substitution)

* 4 tbsp of coconut oil &mdash; I use <span class="highlight">[Nariel organic cooking oil by CGA](http://cgacaribbean.com/products/oils-fats/brands/simply_natural_coconut_oil_nariel_coconut_oil1)</span> (you can use any other oil if you don't have coconut, I have used EVOO as well)

* 1 onion diced

* 1-2 garlic cloves minced

* 1 tsp of grated fresh ginger

* 1 can of coconut milk or approx 1 1/2 cups

* 1/2 tsp of chilli flakes (omit or add less if you don't like heat)

* 2-3 pimento peppers chopped (optional if you don't have any)

* Salt and pepper to taste

* 2-3 tbsp of curry powder of choice and 1 tbsp of water mixed to a paste or slurry
<br>

### Directions

1. Clean and cut fillets and season with salt and pepper

1. In a medium frying pan heat up the oil to medium/high and pan fry the fish in batches cooking them until lightly brown/crisp on both sides (don't worry if they are not fully cooked through they will finish cooking in the sauce) and then set aside

1. In a medium sauce pan heat up the remaining oil to medium heat and add in your onion first and sauté until soft and then add the garlic, chilli flakes, <span class="highlight">[green seasoning](http://oliveandmango.com/green-seasoning)</span> and ginger and sauté for another minute or two.

1. Add the curry paste and cook it stirring it around in the pan for a minute or so

1. Add the coconut milk and allow it to come to a boil and then add the fish and turn down the heat to a simmer and simmer for another 10-15 minutes or until fish is cooked through and sauce has reduced to the thickness you prefer. Season with salt and pepper to taste as you go along.  
<br>

Note: if you don't have green seasoning feel free to just chop up lots of green onion and cilantro and fresh thyme as a substitute or you an use the pre-made bottled green seasoning found in the Caribbean or ethnic sections of some grocery stores.
