I'm literally writing this post on my flight back to Trinidad. We had such a nice time visiting home and I have to say this time around I really don't have the same desire to go back. I think it has a lot to do with me missing my friends and family in Canada and leaving it way to long to go back home for a visit. We were back home before going to Europe last year same time but for a brief few hour stint and it was definitely not enough. So it's been over 2 years since I went home for a proper visit and it seems that for me that is way too long. My husband feels sort of the same but he also thinks it has a lot to do with the weather being so beautiful while we were in Canada.  He thinks we both might feel differently if it was winter while visiting. So although I'm not super excited to be going back to Trinidad it is still home for the moment and I have lots to do when I get back so there's a bit of a sense of urgency and duty to going back.

Ok thats it for the personal stuff for now. Lets get at these muffins.  Plain and simple they are delicious and what also makes them so darn good is the fact that they are easy to make. I love the dark chocolate chunks inside them. They are not overpoweringly chocolatey or coconutty and the banana is mellow in them too. They make for a great combination. I adapted this recipe actually from two recipes. A random one from the food network and a Donna Hay recipe. I replaced the fat and flour from the original recipes and also used less sugar.  I am always on the look out for recipes using ripe bananas or frozen bananas because I always have them on hand and this is a great quick and easy recipe to make with any ripe bananas you might have laying around. They are moist and chocolatey especially since I like using chocolate chunks instead of chips in this recipe ensuring that each bite has a decent amount of chocolates in it. I topped them with a few more chunks of chocolate and also some toasted coconut chips which were the perfect addition! Hope you give these little lovelies a go and enjoy them as much as we did!!

## Dark Chocolate Coconut Banana Muffins

### Ingredients

* 2&frac12; cups all purpose flour
* &frac12; cup desiccated coconut
* &frac34; cup coconut sugar or brown sugar
* &frac14; cup cocoa
* &frac12; tsp of baking soda
* Pinch of salt
* 2 cups mashed bananas (approx 4)
* 2 eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* &frac12; cup coconut oil or vegetable oil of choice
* &frac12; cup coconut milk
* 100 g of dark chocolate chopped into pieces or you can use chips too (I reserve a little to top the muffins with before they go in the oven)
* &frac14; cup toasted coconut to top the muffins with (optional)

### Directions

1. Preheat over to 350 &deg; F and place your muffin liners in the muffin tin

1. In a large mixing bowl combine and whisk together the flour, desiccated coconut, cocoa, baking soda and pinch of salt and set aside

1. In another large bowl mash the bananas and then mix in (I use a mixer to do this) the eggs, sugar, oil, coconut milk and vanilla extract.

1. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix until just combined. Using a spatula to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl ensuring everything is mixed well and then stir in the chocolate chunks

1. Scoop out the batter evenly between the 12 cups in the tin, top with a little more chopped chocolate and the toasted coconut and then bake for 25 minutes or until tester inserted in them comes out clean

1. Allow them to cool for a couple minutes and then remove from pan and allow them to cool completely on a wire rack.
&#42; i also love to sprinkle any chocolatey baked goods with a little bit of coarse sea salt which is absolutely delicious but is also completely optional
