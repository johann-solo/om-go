I can't even tell you how many times I have made this! It's such a great recipe for so many reasons.  First the chicken tastes darn good every time, second it's easy and pretty much uses basic pantry ingredients for the sauce, third it's a very low maintenance recipe meaning not a ton of steps, basically dump ingredients in a bowl, whisk, pour and bake.  A lot of homemade sauces need to be cooked and reduced.  Well those steps are non-existent in this recipe because all that happens the same time the chicken is cooking.  
<br>

You don't have to use the [green seasoning](http://oliveandmango.com/green-seasoning) but I think a little marinating goes a long way with any meat and I have learned from cooking for Trinis, that unseasoned meat is just not done. Greeks have the same philosophy though too.  We marinate everything in you guessed it - olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and oregano. I get it though, the meat is way more flavourful and with this recipe, it lends to the flavour of the BBQ sauce.

I also use thighs with bone in which makes this recipe very cost effective, but in general I love dark meat for its flavour and moisture retention quality. The bone in adds so much flavour to the chicken as well.  Not to say that this won't work with other poultry pieces but the recipe is made for thighs.  So if your using larger pieces like breast just make sure to adjust cooking time as they usually take longer to cook through. I find it a lot easier when I use all the same meat because all the pieces pretty much cook through at the same time.  So that means less times you have to check and worry about whether the wing is burning and the breast is still raw.  You know what I mean? Simplicity is key!

I have taken this chicken to many gatherings/potlucks and it's a guaranteed crowd pleaser.  Imagine my humble little chicken was done and licked up before a bucket of KFC! Not a big feat you say? Well for here it is.  Trini's really love their KFC so it was a real testimony to how good this chicken is. Don't take my word for it though, give it a shot yourself and let me know how it goes.
