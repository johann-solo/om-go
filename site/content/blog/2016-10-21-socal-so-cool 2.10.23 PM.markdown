excerpt: A local's guide to the top 5 budget-friendly things to do in LA
---

I have always wanted to visit California but never seemed to have the opportunity to.  California was one of those places that Hollywood kind of built up in my mind.  And visiting it really lived up to the hype.  From picturesque beaches to the Hollywood sign and to the most cliche tourist traps - I loved it all!

Before we hear about my top rate places to see and do in Southern California I though it best to hear from a local. Helping me out on this blog post today is my IG friend @glamanatti aka Shauna also [theglamanatti.com](http://www.theglamanatti.com). She is more than a fashion blogger. She also shares tips on blogging in general. She has some great Youtube content as well. You need to check out her social media! I know many of my friends will love her curly hair routine for natural hair on YouTube! Why is she helping out with this post? Well she grew up in Southern California and knows a thing or two about what to do when you are visiting. But let me say no more, here is what she had to say:

One thing about me is that I am originally from Los Angeles. Never thought much of it until I started to attend college in the Bay Area, my appreciation of LA. has grown since then. I believe Southern California is the place to be, especially LA. So here are my top 5 places you must visit while in LA.
<br><br>

* *Disclaimer- Although some of these places are free admission, you might have to pay for parking.*

1. **Hollywood Sign Cost: FREE**
<br>
The Hollywood Sign is what brings LA together. This is what aspiring actors and models look at to remind them what LA can provide for them. You cannot miss out on taking a picture next to this iconic sign. Although it is an Instagram worthy photo, the hike up is a workout! So bring a water bottle, a hat and comfy shoes for a comfortable hike.
<br><br>

2. **Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles Cost: $$**
<br>
Everyone hypes In n Out, but  you HAVE to try Roscoe's House Of Chicken N Waffles. Yes dinner AND breakfast, at the same time! Even if you don't eat meat, you have to try their grits and waffles, and it sure ain't no Eggo! The last time I ate their waffles, I felt like I was in heaven. Here is a teaser: they give you a big soft & fluffy waffle with a nice lump of soft butter on top with a side of warm syrup that's enough to smother your waffle in. It's delicious. You have to go.
<br><br>

3. **We all love Disneyland, but have you tried Knotts Berry Farm? Cost: $$**
<br>
I LOVE Disneyland, I loved going every year when I was a kid. As I got older, Disneyland's popularity has heightened and so has their prices. If spending  $100 on amusement park ticket is making you cringe, I suggest you check out Knotts Berry Farm. Knotts Berry Farm is a western themed amusement park that offers  adrenaline pumping rides, at an affordable cost of $40 per person. They also have a restaurant  called Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner, which I recommend checking out if you're craving buttery soft biscuits and moist fried chicken!
<br><br>

4. **City Walk- Cost: Free**
I love Universal studios, but if you happen to not have time, at least check out City Walk! This is where you can find *It's Sugar* and the *Simpsons Doughnut*, which I highly recommend you check out. For starters, *It's Sugar* is cool because they carry your favorite traditional candies,  odd candies you never heard of, humorous things and some items that only adults should see. Do not leave City Walk without trying a *Simpsons Doughnut*, they are as big as your head but taste SO amazing. Try the pink one, but whichever doughnut you get, get one with LOTS of frosting. Or you could buy a Simpsons Doughnut from the factory called, Lard Lad Donuts, located near City Walk. Check out more info [here](https://www.yelp.com/biz/lard-lad-donuts-universal-city-2)
<br><br>

5. **Olvera Street - Cost: Free**
<br>
Get a taste of vintage Mexico by visiting Olvera street. This is one of my places to visit,  shop and get authentic Mexican food! Olvera street is a historical landmark that you can't help to fall in love with because of its beauty and the amount of appreciation it has of the Mexican culture.

Thanks Shauna for your excellent suggestions!!! I need to go back and check out numbers 2-4!! There's always a good reason to go back to Southern California.  Stay tuned next week for part 2 of this series.  I will try to keep it a top ten list, but no promises. There's so much awesomeness to see in Southern California!!!!
