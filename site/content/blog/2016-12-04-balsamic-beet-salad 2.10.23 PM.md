I really love eating salads and I especially love eating salads that incorporate more than just lettuce but I usually don't make these on a days to day basis.  But I love making them for company and for weekend meals when I have more time to prepare them. Yes they do involve a little work and prep but it's so worth it because they taste fabulous. They are also usually so nourishing especially this one.  It's got your greens covered.  Arugula is not only punchy and delicious but also super good for you (full of antioxidants, mineral, vitamin K and chlorophyll). It also has beets which are not just the most beautiful things you can look at but are also super good for you (immune boosting and full of vitamin C, fibre and potassium).

Then you have your crunch factor.  Those delicious caramelised spiced pecans(rich source of energy, and contain health nutrients, minerals, antioxidants and vitamins). So good! Try not to eat them all before putting your salad together. In fact, its probably best if you make a double batch cause you won't stop eating them.  Also that goat cheese crumble just goes so well with the sweetness of this salad and it's easier to digest than other cheeses. It's always a crowd favourite and it's so pleasing to the eyes also.  Just an all around beautiful looking and beautiful tasting salad. Hope you enjoy making, eating and sharing this with friends and family.

## Roasted balsamic beet salad with goat cheese and caramelised pecans
<br>


### Ingredients

* 2-3 cups of arugula washed and spun dry
* 2 large beets washed peeled and chopped into bite sized pieces
* 1/2 cup of goat cheese crumbled
* 1/4 -1/2 cup balsamic vinegar plus an extra tbsp
* 1 tbsp EVOO
* 3/4 cup pecans
* 1 tbsp butter
* 1 tbsp maple syrup
* 1 tbsp brown sugar
* 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper (optional)
* 1/4 tsp of Himalayan salt or sea salt
<br><br>

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and

1. Toss chopped beets in EVOO and 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar and a pinch of salt and then roast them on baking sheet for 45 min to an hour or until done (can also boil beets if you prefer but with roasting you get a nicer flavour) once done remove from oven and let cool

1. In a medium pan toast pecans at medium/low heat until fragrant and darkened tossing and stirring them in the pan often so they do not burn. Once done remove from pan and set aside. Heat butter in pan until melted and return pecans into pan and toss to coat them with butter. Pour in maple syrup and sugar and stir well and continuously while syrup and sugar bubble away.   Turn heat down if needed, add in your cayenne if using and stir them until the syrup is almost evaporated.  Place them on a cookie sheet or plate, sprinkle them with salt and let them cool and dry

1. In a small sauce pan heat balsamic vinegar at medium. Once it starts to boil turn it down to a light simmer and let it simmer for a few minutes until it's reduced and thick enough to pour. Set aside.

1. Toss the arugula with a light vinaigrette of your choice or leave plain( I toss it with a little EVOO and a little more balsamic or red wine vinegar) and then plate

1. Top arugula with beets, goat cheese and pecans and drizzle with balsamic reduction and enjoy!!
