excerpt: <p>Small bites of explosive flavour</p>

---

Just like my chocolate peanut butter energy balls, these mocha fudge bites are a hit in my house. My husband and I love to have something sweet after dinner but nothing too heavy (I'm the one reaching for a few blocks of chocolate in the fridge after din din). These do the trick all the time and are loaded with good stuff so really a no-guilt kind of dessert. I crave them in the early afternoon when I want a little nudge or a kick to help get over the after lunch slump thanks to the coffee, cocoa powder and cacao nibs. They would also be a perfect snack for pre or post workout too because of the peanut butter punch of protein in them.

All you need is a little square bite to really satisfy that sweet tooth. They are rich without being too heavy and sugary like regular fudge. Made with simple ingredients, but will keep you coming back to your fridge for more. They are totally vegan and sugar free, completely plant based, but fear not (if you're not inclined that way) they lack nothing as a fudge! Totally fabulous!! Hope you give them a try and see what the hype's about!

### Ingredients

* 2 cups desiccated unsweetened coconut

* 1/2 cup of natural peanut butter (mine was homemade just added tsp or two of coconut oil while processing it and a pinch of salt)

* 1/4 cup of coconut oil (I used <span class="highlight">[CGA](http://www.cgacaribbean.com)</span> extra virgin coconut oil)

* 1-2 tbsp of brewed strong coffee/espresso or instant if you prefer

* 1/3 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder (I used local cocoa made by <span class="highlight">[Cocobel](http://cocobelchocolate.com))</span>

* 1/4 cup of maple syrup or more to sweeten according to taste

* 1 tsp pure vanilla extract

* 3 pitted dates

* A pinch of sea salt

* Topped with cacao nibs, shredded coconut and very coarse sea salt
<br>

### Directions


1. Line a loaf pan or small square baking pan with parchment paper

1. In a food processor process the desiccated coconut until it becomes paste-like and smooth.  It takes served minutes of processing and stopping in between to scrape the sides depending on the strength of food processor.  Even if it's coarser in texture it will still taste great so no stress

1. Then add to the coconut paste the peanut butter, coconut oil, cocoa powder, maple syrup, sea salt and vanilla extract and processed until well incorporated and smooth

1. Add the dates and pulse a few times until incorporated and taste for sweetness. Add more maple syrup for more sweetness and also that and coconut oil if mixture is too thick.

1. Pour contents into the loaf pan and smooth out. Top with topping listed or any other toppings you prefer.  

1. Refrigerate for at least an hour before cutting them into square bites.  Store any leftovers in a sealed container in the fridge.
