Yes yes yes I know I said not all the bowls I will be making in collaboration with my friends at the [@trainingpad](https://www.instagram.com/trainingpad) will be made with grilled chicken. I did not lie I promise. This is the last grilled chicken bowl. The other two will have something other than chicken.  But I had to share this recipe for jerk chicken since I last made it using Dennis Prescott's recipe from Eat Delicious that we did last month for rainy day bites cookbook club. It was fabulous untouched but I wanted to further 'caribbeanise' it or 'Trinify' it. I did and it was fabulous.

Why did I decide to do that to a perfectly good recipe?  Well I had leftovers the day after I grilled the chicken and made burgers out of them, and had my Jamaican friend over for lunch and she told me they were very close to authentic Jamaican jerk but missing something.  We deduced it was green seasoning and pimientos or allspice berries which are very prominent in Jamaican dishes.

So I marinated the chicken in [green seasoning](https://www.oliveandmango.com/green-seasoning), a very typical seasoning that I season all meats with when I'm cooking anything Trini-style. It's absolutely fabulous and if you don't make it fresh just grab an inexpensive bottle of it in the ethnic section of your nearest grocery store like No Frills for my Toronto people. At least that is where I remember them being but things could very well have changed since 5 years ago when I was still living in Canada. It's super simple to make if you don't get the bottled stuff though.

When I made it for the cook book club it was for a burger as you can see from some pics of the shoot we did for it on IG and it's absolutely delicious in burger form  but I thought it would also be great as a full meal with Caribbean style rice and peas. My take on rice and peas has even more protein (high already from the peas)because I made it with quinoa. My husband said he preferred it over rice so it's a winner over here.  I used pigeon peas in the recipe but you can definitely sub in black beans or red beans too.

Pineapple chow or salsa is one of my favourites and thought it would add a bit of natural sweetness to the dish plus it tastes fabulous and you will love it not to mention the vitamin C boost it provides. I added avocado for some good fat and extra nutrients.  Put it all together and you have a bit of a Caribbean dream! Now all you need is the palm trees and sandy beach! Hope you enjoy this bowl of sunshine! It comes together in under 30 minutes and is chalk full of protein and nutrients and also some spice and sweetness!
