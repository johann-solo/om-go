excerpt: <p>​Best way to eat popsicles for breakfast &mdash; a perfect hot weather treat with only the good stuff in it!</p>

​
It's really hot over here &mdash; like right from the get go! Not from 9 or 10 but right from 6AM. I'm also a morning coffee drinker so my internal temp is usually sky high before I leave my home (can anyone relate or is it just me?) so these little pops are the perfect cooling breakfast that I can even take on the go. Not only are they practical for hot weather, they are also quite delicious!

Peaches and cream should always be inseparable I think, even in popsicles. These literally taste like a bowl of yoghurt topped with peaches, granola and drizzled with honey &mdash; except colder! Heehee! Why make this beautiful breakfast bowl into a popsicle? Simple because we can and it works, and it works well!

These popsicles aren't limited to breakfast but they are a perfect snack and even dessert-like too, think peach crisp with vanilla frozen yoghurt on top!

I love the tangy yoghurt flavour and I upped the probiotic effect on mine by using goat milk kefir instead of milk.  I love the flavour of goat milk and yoghurt and in fact you could use goat yoghurt in place of the regular one too, but if you are not a fan then it's perfectly fine and delicious to use regular milk and yoghurt.  The kefir has some great gut benefits and that's why I like including it in recipes so much!

So go ahead and have them for breakfast, take them to go as a quick snack or even as a nice and cool desert! You will love this icy peach pop, any how you eat it!

### Ingredients
Makes at least 6 medium sized popsicles
<br>
<br>

* &frac12; cup Greek yoghurt plus a couple of extra tbsp
* &frac12; cup of milk  plus more if need to thin out mixture (I used Amaré probiotics goat milk kefir for a little extra probiotic boost)
* 1-1&frac12; cups of chopped fresh or frozen peaches and a few extra pieces chopped to top yoghurt with
* 2-3 tbsp of maple syrup or honey or your choice of sweetener plus more if you want them sweeter
* &frac12; tsp vanilla extract
* &frac12; cup of granola of your choice (<span class="highlight">[my homemade granola](https://www.oliveandmango.com/vanilla-almond-granola)</span> would be perfect with these pops)
<br>

### Directions

1. Blend the peaches (reserving a tbsp or two of them), the milk, vanilla extract, maple syrup,  and yoghurt (reserving a bit of the yoghurt as well) in a blender until nice and smooth, add more milk to thin it out if needed

1. Pour the mixture into the molds until &frac34; full

1. Top with a dollop of yoghurt into each mold followed by a couple of pieces of peaches

1. Place a wooden ice cream stick in the mold and top the pops with the granola

1. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight until they are completely frozen

1. To remove the popsicles from the mold just run the mold under some hot water for a few seconds until they come loose and enjoy
