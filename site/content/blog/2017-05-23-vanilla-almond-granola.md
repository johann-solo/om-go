excerpt: Know exactly what's in your granola by making it yourself
---

One of the things I make homemade and enjoy making is granola. It is a weekly or bi-monthly food prep item i make regularly including peanut butter.  Yes it's cheaper but that's not really the only reason I make it.  When you make your own granola and peanut butter and other similar goods you really can control what goes into them.  A lot of store bought brands - even some that claim that they are natural have a lot of other added ingredients that you may not want to be including in your daily diet.  Understandably they may include preservatives to lengthen shelf life but many also contain a lot of sugar as well as added artificial flavourings. So I like to make these things at home myself because one they are pretty simple to put together, and two they are pretty quick to make or at least don't take a lot of prep time, and three you can customize the flavours.

There are a few brands I do splurge on if I want to get them as a kind of a treat once in awhile for granolas and nut butters but they aren't cheap &mdash; so I tend to make more than buy the pre-made. Plus my husband loves this granola so I always like to keep it on hand. I think you will love it too. You can jazz it up by adding more seeds, nuts, or even dried fruit which would add to the flavour of it but my husband doesn't really like raisons or dried fruit in his cereal or granola so i make it without. You could also make them with gluten free oats although technically i think oats in general are gluten free depending on how they are handled when processed.  Anyway you have them, they are delicious! This granola has a nice crispy crunch not a break your teeth on it kind of crunch and it goes with everything.  I have it as a snack all the time with fruit and PB, top my smoothie bowls with it, and my husband has it regularly as a cereal or with yoghurt. Here it's pictured with yoghurt and [roasted grapes](https://www.oliveandmango.com/labneh-roasted-grapes). I have a couple other go to flavours up my sleeve and will share them with you guys soon! I should also really share my peanut butter recipe too. I probably will on IG cause it's not rocket science to make! Hope you like this simple recipe and do tell me what you like to add to your homemade granola!

### Ingredients

* 3 cups old fashion rolled oats (not quick oats)
* 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/4 to 1/2 cup maple syrup (I prefer maple syrup because it's runnier and get incorporated well), honey or agave for sweetness
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1 cup shredded coconut (I use unsweetened)
* 1/4 cup chia seeds (optional)
* 1/2 to 3/4 cup of chopped almonds
* 1/4 to 1/2 of coconut oil (I use <span class="highlight">[CGA extra virgin coconut oil](http://cgacaribbean.com)</span>)
* A pinch of salt
<br>

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 300 &deg; F

1. In a large bowl combine all ingredients and stir until everything is well combined and well coated &mdash; add more sweetener of choice to taste and oil if mix is too dry

1. Spread evenly and in a thin layer so that it can crisps up on either one extra large baking sheet or two medium sized ones and bake until golden  brown and crisp &mdash; approx 30 minutes and check and shake pan around a little one or two times throughout baking time

1. Remove and let stand to cool for 1-2 hours until completely cool and very crispy.  You don't want to store it in a container as soon as it's out of the oven because it will get moist and mushy from the moisture  created by heat   

1. Once completely cool - seal in airtight container.  This doesn't last longer than a week in our household so it should be fine for at least a week if not more if it lasts that long.
