excerpt: 'More than a purée, and delicious enough to eat by the spoonful'

Apples are one of the top things I miss about living in Canada. It sounds kind of lame to miss apples right but let me explain. Obviously I miss my friends and family and other conveniences but apples are a food I really miss. Yes we get them here but I have yet to bite into a fabulous crisp apple and I'm not being negative about Trinidad in any way by saying that. They just don't grow here and the ones we get are all imported so they will never taste the same as freshly picked apples. They are alright but so many of them are soft and grainy and just not the same. So you better believe I'm happy to be going home at the peak of apple season and I will be gorging on them!  Can't wait to pick a few as well!

This is a super simple way of making homemade apple butter and I'm super happy to share it. It's especially great if apple picking is in your near future and will be getting loads and loads of them. Just another great way to use your supply.

I searched and tested a few recipes and this is my favourite combo of flavours.  I have bought apple butter before and I always wanted to make some and I have to tell you I will probably not purchase it again cause it truly is super easy to make and takes minimal effort.  There's a lot of apple butter recipes out there for the slow cooker but this is a lot quicker to make stove top and the result is pretty much the same. At least that's what I found.

Other than eating it from the jar with a spoon, what in the world do you do with apple butter? So many yummy things! Obviously you can use it as a spread like I did on my Instagram with that black forest ham and cheese open faced sandwich. I love combining sweet and savoury and apples go really well with pork, so you can definitely add it to to your pulled pork, to your pork chops and I made a variation of pork and beans (recipe I'm stoked to share soon) and added it to them and those beans were divine!

I also made a spice cake with it (sharing that soon too) and you can definitely add it to any bread as well. It would be great in an apple and cinnamon loaf or babka. It would also be great to add to your apple pie filing and an apple galette. This is just the beginning - there are so many other things to include it in. It's also great on buttered toast &ndash; something I have been snacking on non stop since I made it.  Hope you like this simple yet delicious recipe and I would love to hear what you like to add your apple butter to!

### Ingredients
Yields approx 1 to 1&frac12; cups of apple butter

* 2-2&frac12; lbs apples (approx 8-10 small apples)
* &frac12; cup Apple cider vinegar
* &frac12; cup pure apple juice or cider
* &frac34; cup coconut sugar or brown sugar
* 1 tbsp maple syrup
* &frac14; tsp vanilla extract
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* &frac14; tsp ground allspice
* &frac14; tsp ground nutmeg
* Pinch of ground clove
* Pinch of salt

### Directions

1. Wash and scrub apples well, core and slice apples and add them to a medium sized pan (peel and all) adding with them the Apple cider vinegar and also the apple juice. Bring to a boil and reduce to a low simmer, cover and let simmer for 20 minutes.

1. Remove lid, stir the apples and continue to simmer them for another 20-30 minutes until the apples are very tender and have thickened from breaking down and then remove them from the heat and allow them to cool for a few minutes.

1. Put the apples in a food processor (being very careful especially if they are still on the hot side) and process until smooth or use a potato masher and mash until they are smooth.  

1. Transfer the processed apples to a fine mesh sieve over a bowl and press the pulp through the sieve so that your left with a creamy smooth apple purée

1. Put the purée back into the pot turn the heat back on to medium low and add the remaining ingredients. Cook stirring occasionally until the apple butter is a deep rich colour, the sugar has melted through and it's nice and thick (won't take longer than 5-10 minutes).

1. Remove from heat and let cool for a few minutes and transfer to a  sealed container and it can last for up to a month refrigerated.
