excerpt: A delicious pick me up

One of the first times that I tried one of these types of energy or bliss balls I almost gagged.  The texture and the flavour was not what I expected and especially didn't expect it from the brand either or the price I paid for one of them. (I will not say the brand but it's a big one for these little guys) I was not impressed at all and thought there had to be a way to make these taste great and also be full of good stuff!!

> raw cacao and nibs add that intense chocolate flavour

I wanted to make them more moist and less Lärabar tasting.   That is not the brand by the way and I don't hate Lärabar's but sometimes that kind of fruit roll up fruitiness, stickiness and texture can be a little off putting to me.  The one I was talking about earlier was very dominantly &lsquo;dateish&rsquo; and oddly dry.  Weird. Anyways everyone has their own taste for things like these.

These ones are moist enough and don't taste saw dusty from the oats at all.  They also don't have an over powering date flavour or that strong chew factor that a lot of date bars/energy bars have.  If you like chocolate and peanut butter I'm pretty sure you will love these.  
<br>

These little guys have helped get me through many long days.  The raw cacao and nibs add that intense chocolate flavour but equally as important is the perk factor they bring. They are great as an afternoon pick me up and definitely great for before or after a work out.

There's absolutely no sugar added to them and they are sweetened by the dates and maple syrup.  The peanut butter adds great protein.  So do the oats as well as being a great source of fibre. The extra pinch of salt on top of them is just perfect. Think salted peanuts dunked in a bit chocolate! The chia adds a little crunch too not to mention more protein and antioxidants.

This recipe is pretty versatile. Keep the oats and date measurements consistent but add any of your favourite nut butter to it.  You can actually add nuts and chocolate chips too. I also like to add shredded coconut to mine as well.  Instead of the cacao powder you could add ground flax. You could also add cranberries and seeds too.  See there's a lot of options. In fact if you have nut allergies you could replace the nut butter with a seed butter like sesame (tahini) or sunflower seed butter.

The options are limitless so feel free to experiment.  The best part is that they are hard to screw up.  If the batter is too dry add more liquid, if it's too wet add more dry etc.  But do try making them and don't bother buying them.  I saw them at a local pharmacy selling for a crazy amount.  Try making them at home. They are easy to make and you can customize to your taste.

## Raw chocolate peanut butter energy bliss balls
Makes 8-12 depending on size
<br><br>


### Ingredients

* 1 cup old fashion rolled oats
* 1/4 cup raw cacao powder
* 1/2 cup peanut butter
* 1/4 cup cacao nibs
* 1/4 cup chia seeds
* 1 cup pitted dates (soaked for a few minutes if needed and drained)
* 1/4 tsp Himalayan salt/sea salt plus another 1/4 tsp of salt for sprinkling balls after
* 2 tbsp of maple syrup (more if needed)
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 tsp of coconut oil (only if needed)
* A couple of ounces of dark chocolate melted and ready to drizzle
<br>

### Directions

1. In a food processor pulse oats and cacao powder a few times or more until oats are very finely ground

1. Add the rest of the ingredients and continue to process until you reach the desired texture.  The 'batter' should be wet or sticky enough to handle and mold. If not it may be too dry so you can add a tsp extra at a time of PB, coconut oil or maple syrup like I did in my IG stories when i was making them

1. Once desired texture is reached spoon them out with an icecream scoop or cookie scoop for uniformity and roll into balls and place on a piece of parchment paper or plate.  

1. Sprinkle with salt and drizzle with dark chocolate. Refrigerate for a few minutes to set the chocolate and then they are ready to enjoy

I like to store mine in the refrigerator (probably because it's always 30 degrees here)
