excerpt: Add a little spice and excitement to your homade BBQ sauce
---

Grilling season is upon many of you friends and pretty much all year round for me.  It's nice to have something quick and easy to grill that has lots of flavour. One of the things I love to grill that fits the bill for all of that is shrimp. They take very little time to cook and don't require lots of marinating time. They also taste fabulous with this Sriracha BBQ sauce. This sauce definitely has some kick which I love but if you are nervous about that just reduce the amount of Sriracha in the recipe by half. You will still get some heat but with less intensity.

The base BBQ sauce without the Sriracha is quite nice but adding the Sriracha bumps it up a flavour notch.  The sauce can work beautifully with any meat whether baked or grilled, and would be wonderful with a pulled pork or even great to slather on a burger, or if you are Trini you will definitely love slathering this on your pizza! I served these BBQ shrimp over a bed of pasta with grilled veggies and lots of olive oil and garlic and it was fabulous but would pair really well with fried rice and greens and really anything you want to pair it with.  Hope you like this spicy little number!

### Ingredients:

For the shrimp

* 1 to 1 1/2 lbs of shrimp of your choice
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Seasoning of your choice - green seasoning or any other to marinade the shrimp while making the sauce (optional because the BBQ sauce has a lot of flavour)
* Wooden skewers
<br>

For the sauce:

* 1 cup tomato ketchup
* 1 cup water
* 1/4 cup Apple cider vinegar or white vinegar as an alternative
* 2 tsp of lemon or lime juice or if you don’t have add more apple cider vinegar
* 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
* 5 tbsp brown sugar
* 2 tsp mustard powder or Dijon mustard
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1/2 tsp cayenne
* 2 tsp onion powder or garlic powder  (you can use fresh garlic and onion and fry it up before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients in the pan -but then just blend it afterwards for a smooth sauce unless you don't mind it chunky)
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 1 tbsp pomegranate molasses or regular molasses (optional but a great addition)
* 1/4 cup Sriracha sauce
<br>

### Directions

Soak your wooden skewers in water while you prep the BBQ sauce and shrimp.

1. Mix all sauce ingredients together in a medium sauce pan on medium heat. Once its starts to simmer turn the heat down a little and stir occasionally for approx. 20 minutes or until sauce has thickened. Do not let the sauce boil.

1. Clean and devein shrimp if needed and season with salt and pepper and other seasoning of choice and then stack your skewers with the shrimp and set aside while the grill gets hot

1. Heat the grill up and coat with a bit of oil and “put the shrimp on the barbie”. They don’t take long to cook 2-5 min per side depending on size and then slather on the sauce and grill for for another minute per side to allow the sauce to caramelize. Don't forget to coat the other side before flipping them.  

1. Serve with more sauce on the size

1. Store leftover barbecue sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a few weeks
