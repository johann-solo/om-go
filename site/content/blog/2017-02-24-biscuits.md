excerpt: The easiest cream biscuits you will ever make
---

We got a beautiful little gift from my sister in law recently.  A jar of bacon butter and WOW! Sweet and salty with a hint of spice and the perfect texture and spreadability! It took a lot of self control to not just eat it from the jar by the spoonfuls! Not that I didn't do that at all but I really had to calm it down!

I don't know about you guys but I love DIY gifts and homemade preserves as gifts.  They are my total favourites when it comes to gifts. From homemade pepper sauce, jams, jellies to this bacon jam, I love them all! In fact Im taken by anything edible really. There's a lot of love care and sometimes sweat that goes into gifts like that and they are usually so delectable and oh so tasty!!

I wanted to make something I could spread this awesome jam on so I decided on this recipe I came across on thekitchen website.  Super easy and no fuss biscuits.  I just tweaked it by adding some old white cheddar and the chive and herbs. It's now a staple and I love them plain or with the add ins.  You can really get creative with your add ins too.  You could add in bacon or sausage, play around with cheeses and or herbs and anything savoury would go well with this recipe.  I found that as long as you keep your extra ingredients to 1/2 cup or under and are using ingredients that aren't overly wet or wet at all, then the basic recipe will come out wonderfully every time. I plan on experimenting with coconut. I think the subtle sweetness of the coconut will be perfect with these buttery ( no butter in them though) biscuits.

Because they are so quick and easy to make they are perfect for brunch or If you have over-night guests and want to whip up something quick and fresh out of the oven for them.  The smell of these baking is enough to get anyone out of bed! And no one needs to know that there was very little work involved in making them. They literally take 15-20 minutes to make including baking time and all made in one bowl. They are super hard to resist and I ate like three while we were shooting the pics for this post.

You can make the bacon jam in advance and what a pair these two make. Although to tell you the truth that bacon jelly does just fine on its own but to be civilised it's good to accompany it with a bread like substance. And why not these fab quick and easy biscuits?!?!
