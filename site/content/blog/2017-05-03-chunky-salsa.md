excerpt: A salsa that truly lives up to it's name
---

This very much lives up the name of it! You think you're done but nope ya got to go back for more. It's a weird thing because it's so simple and basic but totally addictive. If you notice in the recipe I have a few substitutions, and that's just in case you don't have access to our local flavours, you can make it the way I make it when I'm back home.  I love using fresh local ingredients when I'm here and the exact flavours of the scotch bonnet hot pepper and chadon beni really can't be replicated.  Don't get me wrong it's just as fabulous with cilantro and jalapeño peppers too but it's just different. The flavours are great either way but they are distinctly different. The ketchup in case you were wondering why the ketchup, is optional, but I think it's the perfect way to balance the acidity of the tomatoes and also add a little body to the salsa.

So let's talk salsa. There are so many ways of making salsa. So many flavour combos and so many different ways of preparation, thicknesses and even textures. I am not partial when it comes to salsa! I love and eat them all! My least favourite is probably salsas that have a lot of fruit in them like pineapple and mango. I will still eat them if they are in front of me but that type of salsa wouldn't be my first choice. So what is this one like? This one is very fresh tasting (not in a Trini fresh - bad way) but in that the the ingredients are fresh and vibrant tasting! Like a party in your mouth! It's super quick to whip up and it uses very basic ingredients. I make it a lot when I have people over and love to take it to friend's house too when we are invited. It gets gobbled up fast and people always ask about the recipe.  So here it is! Hope you like it!
