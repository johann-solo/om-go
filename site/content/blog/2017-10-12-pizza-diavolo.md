excerpt: My classic favourite pepperoni and cheese pizza with a little extra heat
---

You can call me boring when it comes to my favourite pizza and I’m okay with it. Classic pepperoni and cheese is my favourite. I love it cause I feel like I get to taste all of the pizza elements individually. Each distinct flavour. I can enjoy the crust, the sauce and the pepperoni and cheese with out them getting muddled with a million other flavours on my pizza. Don’t get me wrong I enjoy other ones too, especially when they add a sweet component but my all time favourite &ndash; the one I most definitely will order every time is a basic pepperoni and cheese.  When I do order it I love to sprinkle chili flakes and or chili oil on it for a little extra kick of flavour and then I’m basically in pizza heaven! And you best not be thinking of taking one of my slices cause I’m serious about my pizza!!

I thought I would make my own version of this classic Pizza Diavolo which is called that because it’s devilishly hot and spicy. Mine isn’t that spicy but it has a bit of heat and I love it.  I added some heat to the sauce with some chili flakes as well as CGA’s infused coconut chili oil which adds the most perfect smokiness to the pizza sauce. I also like to drizzle some more of it on after it’s baked for a little extra flavour.

> It’s my favourite pizza crust and is now the only one I make

I got the original recipe for this crust from Eat Delicious and although I don’t have the “00” flour he uses in his recipe it turns out just as great using bread flour.  It’s my favourite pizza crust and is now the only one I make. I love the texture. It’s not quite thin crust but has a thin crust quality and I also love how its edges puff up a bit when it’s baked. Feels like I’m having authentic style pizza! The best part is the recipe makes two pizzas and I usually make the dough the night before and it does all the rising overnight in the fridge and then it’s ready to go when I get home from work. Oh and did I mention it bakes in under 15 minutes!Perfect for Friday night pizza. Why order when you can make a fab pie at home! Am I right?

I used spicy pepperoni and it was perfect! You can take the heat down by using regular pepperoni if you prefer a tamer (lamer lol) pizza. Whatever you decide spicy or not so spicy you will adore this pizza! It’s simple to whip up (both the sauce and the dough) and it’s also pretty much a no fail recipe. So go ahead and make it for your next pizza night! You will definitely enjoy it!!

* &frac14; tsp cayenne pepper
* &frac14; tsp of dried chili flakes

<br>

**For the dough**
* 2 tsp active dry yeast
* 1 tbsp honey
* 1 cup plus 5 tbsp of lukewarm water
* 1&frac12; cups all purpose flour- plus more for dusting
* 1&frac12; cups bread flour or “OO” flour as recommended in original recipe and if you can find it
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tsp salt
<br>

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 550 or 500 &deg; F according to your oven

1. Line to pizza baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside

1. Mix all sauce ingredients together and set aside or place in a sealed container and refrigerate if not making the pizza immediately

1. In a large bowl combine the yeast, honey, and water and stir well. Set aside for about 10 minutes to allow the yeast to activate and bubble up.

1. Add the flours, olive oil, and salt to the bowl and stir with a wooden spoon until a mass of dough begins to form. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and put your timer on for ten minutes and start kneading.

1. Transfer the dough to a bowl that has been lightly greased and cover with plastic wrap.  Place in a warm spot and let the dough rise and double in size for approx 1 &frac12; hours. If you’re making ahead wrap and place in the fridge to rise overnight. The next day when you plan to use it warm it on the countertop for approx &frac12; hour 45 min before using.

1. Once ready to use, punch down the dough and transfer to a floured surface. Cut the dough in half and shape both into balls

1. Preparing one at a time, roll the dough out with a rolling pin into two 10-12 inch rustic circles

1. Spread &frac12; cup of pizza sauce on each dough round leaving approx 1 inch around the edges bare.  Divide the salami among both pizzas along with the mozzarella.  

1. Transfer pizza to preheated oven and bake for approx 8 minutes until the crust is crispy, and edges are puffy and golden and cheese is melted.  

1. Drizzle with a little chili oil to finish once done. And garnish with some fresh basil and if you dare through on a some more chili flakes
