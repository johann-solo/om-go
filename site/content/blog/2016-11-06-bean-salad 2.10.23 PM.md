Some of my friends and followers might be wondering why in the world do I do so much cooking on the weekends. Well there's quite a simple explanation for that. Firstly, my husband works weekends at the moment. So usually, he's not done work until at least 6-7 depending on how busy things are. Sometimes he's done by 5 and we just don't know what to do with ourselves!! I use the weekends as quiet home-time to do cooking, cleaning, and organising or do errands and grocery shopping so we are set for the week. This is because our days are usually non stop busy during the week and can get very little of that stuff done through the week.

Secondly, I just mentioned we are busy and of course a lot of that has to do with the fact that I have a day job which keeps me quite busy.<br>
<br>

That leads into my third reason. You may be thinking why don't you cook, take pics, and blog in the evening? Well if you didn't already know Trinidad has a consistent sunrise and sunset of 6 and 6 give or take minutes throughout the entire year. On the average I'm home around 5\. To do meal prep, cooking time, pics and post are nearly impossible. Especially since I'm out of the house before 7 every morning. So it leaves a very small window of light for good pics. Blogging problems! Boo hooo! I know it sounds ridiculous but I do want the best pictures to post and share with all of you. It actually takes a bit of work and a lot of planning. But so worth it I think!! I hope you guys think so too!!<br>
<br>

Enough about that though. Now on to one of my favourite, flavourful and super easy to make bean salads. It's very versatile too. You can use whatever beans and legumes you like, and whatever herbs you like as well according to your taste. You don't have to use canned beans either. If your prefer to pre cook your dry beans for this recipe, even better. Nothing beats cooked beans if you have the time. But in a pinch I definitely use canned beans. I try to get the ones with the fewest additives, preferably just brine/water and beans.

The combo of beans, flavours and dressing works really well. I hope you like it as much as I do. I love to bring it to a potluck or a BBQ. It's easy and people love it.<br>

**Bean salad recipe:**

- 1 can drained and rinsed or 3/4 cup-1 cup of cooked beans each of black beans, chick peas, and red kidneys beans
- 1/2 pound of green string beans fresh or frozen, trimmed and chopped in half
- Half of a red onion chopped finely
- 1 whole scallion, green onion or chive chopped finely
- 1/4 cup each fresh chopped dill and parsley
- 1-2 small sweet pickles chopped finely and a tsp of brine from the pickle jar for the dressing (optional but really adds to the flavour of the salad)

**The dressing:**

I won't give measurements because I think it depends on how much your making and how sweet or tart you like your dressing. I like might slightly tart with a bit of sweetness for this bean salad. I do a combination of:

- Lemon juice
- Red wine vinegar or for more sweetness balsamic
- Apple cider vinegar
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- taste and adjust flavour as you go<br>

# Directions:

1. Chop all herbs, onions and pickles and place in a bowl
2. While you are chopping herbs, steam green beans until tender crisp and put in a bowl of ice to stop the cooking process and so they keep that vibrant green colour, then drain well and add them to the bowl
3. Add beans to the bowl and toss gently
4. Prepare dressing, pour over beans and toss to coat. Taste and add more and S &P if needed. Serve and enjoy!

Hope you like my take on this classic. Let me know what else you like to add to your bean salad.
