excerpt: A quick, easy and mouthwateringly delicious taco meal for any day of the week
---

Tacos make me very happy! I’m a fan of all- soft, hard, chicken, pork, beef, and as you can tell fish as well. I love all things wrapped, folded and layered so tacos are definitely a welcome favourite each week in our home. Simply put these fish tacos are mouthwateringly delicious. You can use any type of firm white fish you have available, and this rub is a wonderful one to have on hand which really works well with seafood in general. I have used it in other fish recipes as well as a shrimp rub too.

The slaw is a must and you can use it with any type of tacos you make.  It adds a zesty crunch and acidity that I love to my tacos.   That creamy coconut lime cilantro sauce aka  ‘green sauce’ is also great with all sorts of tacos too, but I especially love it with shrimp and fish tacos. It’s fresh creamy and oh so flavourful! This is a quick and easy recipe for any day of the week and I know you guys will love it!
