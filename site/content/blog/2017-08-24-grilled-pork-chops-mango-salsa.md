excerpt: Summer's not over yet! Make the most out of the grilling season with these delicious pork chops
---

You guys I'm so excited to share this recipe! It's bright and gorgeous looking and so easy to prepare. Grilling season for many of you is still going strong. For us it's 365 days a year which is great because what's better than popping something on the grill for a quick and easy dinner am I right?!?!

I strongly recommend brining your pork chops. It's totally essential and if you haven't done it before you will never go back once you start.  It's simple and all it really requires is water and salt. I use a brine when I'm doing all things pork and poultry especially large chicken breast that can become dry on the grill.

The brine really helps the meat retain its moisture while it's being cooked. You can add all sorts of aromatics to the brine like peppercorns and herbs but the most basic ingredients are like I said, salt and water. It's a simple step that is just too easy not to include and you won't go back I promise.

> The BBQ sauce adds a beautiful sweetness and the adobo brings the heat and smokiness but it is so much more complex than that

The sauce which includes adobo sauce in it is fabulous! You can adjust the heat by adding a little adobo at a time from the tablespoon and a half that I have in the recipe.  That way you don't make it too hot and then can't enjoy your chops. We like a little heat so we always do the full tbsp and a half. Have no fear you can always add more BBQ sauce to the mix if you find it too hot. The BBQ sauce adds a beautiful sweetness and the adobo brings the heat and smokiness but it is so much more complex than that.  Smokiness is the best way to describe it. It has a lot of oomph behind it &ndash; not just heat wise but flavour wise too.

Like I said you can spice up your brine with aromatics but I like to keep the spice rub after brining very simple. It's my basic spice rub that I use for all meat if I'm not using a marinade. You can use <span class="highlight">[green seasoning](https://www.oliveandmango.com/green-seasoning)</span> as well cause I know my fellow Trini's have a hard time parting with it, but I think green seasoning kind of jacks up the flavours too much in this recipe. You want to taste the smokiness and the meat as opposed to tons of other seasonings.  I prefer to keep this one simple with a classic salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder but you could also use an all purpose powdered seasoning too for the rub. Your choice!

### Ingredients

**For the Pork**
* 5 bone in pork chops
* 1 tsp of salt
* 1 tsp of black pepper
* 1 tsp of onion powder
* 1 tsp of garlic powder
* 1&frac12; tbsp of adobo sauce (with out the pepper just the sauce and you can reduce it to 1 tbsp for less heat)
* 1 cup BBQ sauce of your choice or <span class="highlight">[my homemade one](https://www.oliveandmango.com/baked-bbq)</span>

**For the salsa**
* 1-2 mangoes pealed and cut into chunks
* &frac12; a small red onion finely chopped
* &frac14; up chopped chadon beni/cilantro
* 2 tsp olive oil
* Juice of one lime
* A pinch of salt

**For the brine**
* Water
* Salt

### Directions  

1. Place pork chops in a sealable container and cover with water (counting cups of water as you pour it in) until they are completely submerged. Count in cups how much water and add the equivalent amount in tbsp of salt.  
1. Let meat sit in brine for approx 30 minutes
1. Remove meat when ready, pat dry, season generously and rub with salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder.
1. Heat up the grill to medium high and grease it if possible.  
1. Mix together the adobo and the BBQ sauce in a small bowl reserving  a little for serving.
1. Put your chops on the grill and grill for approx 5-7 minutes per side then baste them well with the sauce and continue to grill them on both sides basting generously until the sauce is caramelized and the pork chops have a little char on them.
1. Once done remove them from grill and plate them and tent with foil and let them rest while you make the mango salsa.
1. For the salsa just combine all the ingredients in a bowl seasoning to your liking and then serve with the pork chops.

**Adobo sauce** &ndash; in case you're not familiar, I use the sauce that comes in a can in the Mexican food section of the grocery store that is usually called chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.  I find the peppers are way to spicy to include but if you like spice definitely blend the peppers and sauce with the BBQ sauce but if not just use the sauce and store the rest of the contents in a sealed container to use for another time like in your chili, or to add to other meals and sauces. I always have some on hand because I love the smokiness this sauce adds to things!
<br>
<br>

**No grill no problem!** Pan fry them in a oven safe pan and when you put the BBQ sauce on them transfer them to the oven broil until the sauce is caramelized and the chops are slightly charred - do this for both sides basting generously with the sauce.
