I had to try some of these pancakes after I saw my Instagram feed get completely flooded with them and everything pumpkin. So many delicious version of these out there. I played around with my buttermilk pancake recipe and I also referred to Half Baked Harvest’s (Tieghan) version for a little guidance when it came to pumpkin quantities per batch until I got these ones right and they are pretty fab!!

Think fluffy, pumpkin spiced pancakes with melty chocolate bits floating around each bite! So delicious!! I was hoping to eat the one - you know the one &ndash; the first horrible one you make from your first batch until you get a handle on your heat and butter technique. But unfortunately I was so paranoid I wouldn’t have enough pancakes for the shoot that I was extra careful and mindful with each one and made sure they were all ‘good ones’. That means I had to wait until after the shoot to eat one or three of these babies! It was worth the wait though &ndash; they are great and perfect with some whip and a good drizzle/pool of maple syrup!

These were excellent and the perfect addition to a fall breakfast!! Like you know, we don’t have a fall here in the Caribbean so I whip these up whenever we have a hankering for them. We have our local pumpkin that I purée which is wonderfully sweet and flavourful that grows year round here and I take full advantage of it. I have a quick and easy recipe below for making your own homemade pumpkin purée cause that is what I use.  I don’t make it for the fun of it &ndash; maybe if I was a stay at home person I would find it fun but I do it cause it’s the most cost effective way.

You can get pumpkin purée in a can here &ndash; it’s at some specialty shops here but you can imagine the price for one can! That’s why I make it and the pumpkin is quite inexpensive here and perfect for anything  you would use the canned stuff for. That being said if you have canned pumpkin purée at your disposal definitely use it! Hope you give these a try!! We absolutely crave these all the time and know you will too after you make your first batch!

### Ingredients

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* &frac14; cup sugar
* 2&frac14; teaspoons baking powder
* &frac12; teaspoon baking soda
* &frac12; teaspoon salt
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* &frac12; tsp ground ginger
* &frac14; tsp nutmeg
* 2 eggs
* 1 &frac12; cups buttermilk
* &frac34; cup pumpkin purée canned or homemade (I always use my homemade recipe below)
* &frac14; cup melted unsalted butter, plus some for frying
* 1 cup chocolate chips
* Serving suggestions: whipped cream and maple syrup and some chopped nuts
<br>

### Directions

1. In a large bowl sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and the spices
2. Beat the eggs with the buttermilk, melted butter and the pumpkin purée. Combine the dry and the wet ingredients into a lumpy batter, being careful not to over mix and then mix in the chocolate chips.
3. Heat some butter in a skillet over medium heat. Spoon 1/3 cup of batter into the skillet and sprinkle and cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side.
4. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream and maple syrup and a sprinkling of chopped nuts.

## Homemade Pumpkin Purée

### Ingredients

* 1 whole pumpkin 4-6 lbs or cut pumpkin pieces
* Pinch of salt
<br>

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400 ° F
1. Line one or two baking sheets with parchment paper
2. Slice pumpkin open and scoop out the seeds and fibers (reserve seeds for roasting or something else at another time) and cut up into 1-½ inch square pieces removing the skin
3. Arrange the pieces on baking sheet or sheets and sprinkle with salt and then roast them for 20-40 minutes until fork or knife can easily be inserted
4. Let sheet cool on cooling rack until you pumpkin can be handled and then transfer it all to a food processor and process until the flesh is smooth. Store in the fridge for up to one week and freeze for up to 3 months.

* You can also cut the whole pumpkin in half and roast pieces whole but this takes longer to roast and more work to scrape off the flesh from the skin after. I do both and result is the same it just depends on how much time I have on hand and how lazy I am to chop and peel the pumpkin.
