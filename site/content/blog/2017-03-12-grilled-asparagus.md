Spring is in the air for many and asparagus totally reminds me of spring.  These guys are perfect as a side on their own or can even be enjoyed tossed with a lemon garlic pasta. Either way they are tender, nutty flavoured from that delicious brown butter and have a slight crisp from the grill!!

### Ingredients

* 11/2 lbs. of asparagus washed and trimmed
* 2-3 tbsp butter
* 1 clove of garlic chopped

### Directions

1. In a small pot melt butter over medium heat and let it bubble for a few minutes swirling it in the pot a couple of times, let it continue to cook until it changes colour to a darker yellowy- brown, smells fragrant and nutty, and there are little brown flecks at the bottom of the pot. I use it just like this but many prefer straining the butter to get the brown bits out  (I love the nutty flavour they add)

1. Heat up your grill and clean the grates as needed

1. In the meantime place the asparagus over two large pieces of foil, drizzle with half the lemon juice, the brown butter and top with the garlic, tent and seal the edges of the foil to allow the asparagus to steam up on the grill

1. Place the asparagus in foil onto the grill and close and let it grill for approx 8-10 minutes depending on how thick the asparagus is.

1. Carefully take the package of asparagus off the grill on to a cutting board or plate (I slide mine on to a cutting board) near by and open the foil

1. Place the asparagus on the grill against the line of the grates (otherwise they will fall between) and grill for a couple minutes until golden brown and slightly charred at the edges

1. Remove from the grill, plate and drizzle with the butter lemon garlic sauce remaining in  the foil, sprinkle with salt and drizzle the rest of the lemon juice on them and serve
