excerpt: Summer dessert made easy and delicious. A beautiful take on peaches and
  cream
---

Peaches and nectarines are my jam!  I miss Ontario peaches tremendously and this year was the first time in 5 years living in Trinidad that I decided to just get some! I really don't know where they were imported from. Probably somewhere in the US.  They weren't as expensive as I thought they would be but then again, the quality wasn't exactly great either. But they smelled heavenly.  My head was literally in the bag the whole way home from the little market I picked them up from &mdash; breathing them in!

I came home and was ready to make something yummy out of them. Roasted was the way to go especially with how ripe they were. There was no caprese salad happening with these little guys. Naturally I went with maple syrup as my sweetener but our local honey would work wonderfully. Topped with some toasted pecans and a pinch of cinnamon made these even more fabulous.

Why mascarpone over whip cream or ice cream?  These would be awesome with either of those options but I am a huge fan of mascarpone.  Whip is great but I thought it was a little too light for this dessert.  Ice cream is also great but super sweet, and the sweetness of the peaches almost gets lost, and of course it melts instantly next to the warm peaches. Here's where the mascarpone wins. It's basically very thick whipping cream &mdash; although I'm sure it's more complex than that, but to me that's what it tastes like. I love it and can literally eat it from the tub. (Check out my go-to [homemade recipe for mascarpone](https://www.oliveandmango.com/strawberry-tiramisu)) I didn't sweeten it with anything so it didnâ€™t take away from the peaches but added a beautiful creaminess to the desert and was a delicious match. The toasted pecans added a nice crunch and the cinnamon just enhances the sweetness of the peaches!

I think this would be a great anytime dessert but would look kind of special served individually in glass dessert bowls for a dinner party!! It's a no fuss and minimal effort dessert but the results make it seem otherwise. It's a pretty dreamy desert and leftover roasted peaches were had on ricotta toast. Hope you give it a try and those of you living where peaches grow on trees &mdash; think of me while your slicing into a good one!!
