excerpt: Creamy dreamy cheesy side sure to satisfy everyone!
---

This is another Trini favourite of mine.  It's so easy to make! It's creamy and cheesy and totally a comfort food! If I'm having people over and BBQing you better believe I will be making this to go along with it.  Everyone loves it and my husband asks for it all the time! The texture of it is between a corn bread and a pudding.  It's a recipe you can play around with too! So if you want it creamier then definitely add a little more water or lessen the amount of cornmeal and of course the opposite if you want it a little drier. It's a staple side dish that I always make whether I'm cooking Trini food or not. Whether it cooks creamy or a little on the drier side no need to fret the taste is consistently delicious and it will get eaten up no matter the texture.

It's sweet enough without adding sugar as many recipes call for and the cheese adds a nice slight sharpness and saltiness to the pie. It's fabulous! I like mine heavily seasoned with onions, garlic, peppers and thyme but you don't have to add as much if you want the corn to stand alone in the pie. You can also definitely reduce the amount of cheese if you don't want it to taste amazing. Hehehe! I kid. If you do reduce the cheese I would recommend putting less inside the pie and leave the topping with a heavier amount because it's nice to have cheesy top to bite through. Just my preference though. You can also add some hot pepper to the pie but usually don't. I like to add pepper sauce later.

I usually buy corn meal from the market from the sweetest lady who actually grinds cornmeal by hand herself when she is there and has some available.  For the life of me I cannot remember her company's name since I haven't been to that particular market in a couple of months.  I will have to write it down the next time I go. It's the best quality I have had! Being that its made from a grain, this dish is a great one for anyone who is gluten intolerant or vegetarian. So it's a great dish to bring to a potluck since it's a crowd pleaser and can accommodate those kinds of food restrictions. Give it a try and let me know how you liked it and what little tweaks you made. Always love to get comments and definitely tag me if you make it!! Enjoy game day Sunday!!

### Ingredients

* 2 cans of corn creamed or whole corn in water (or approx two cups of frozen corn)
* 11/2 cups water or broth if using creamed corn or frozen
* 11/2 cups of fine corn meal
* 2 eggs
* 2 tbsp butter
* 1-2 tbsp olive oil
* 2 onions chopped finely
* 2 cloves on garlic minced
* 1 tsp thyme
* 1 bell pepper of choice chopped finely
* 1 handful of pimento peppers chopped finely (if available- if not use another bell pepper)
* 2 cups evaporated milk
* 2 cups grated cheese of choice (I mixed cheddar in the pie and Parmesan for the topping)  
* Salt and pepper to taste
<br>

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F

1. If your using whole kernel corn then drain and reserve liquid from the cans. Pour liquid into measuring cup and top up with water until you have two cups worth of liquid
(If you're using cream corn or frozen corn just add 11/2 cups water/broth)

1. In a large bowl combine and whisk corn liquid or water/broth and eggs

1. Add the cornmeal and mix until it's a smooth paste and set aside

1. Meanwhile heat an oven safe skillet (11 inch) to medium heat and add your oil and butter to pan and then add your onions, peppers, garlic and thyme and saut√© until onions are soft and translucent. Season with salt and pepper.

1. Pour in the milk and bring to a boil then add the cornmeal mixture and immediately reduce heat to low and cook for a few minutes stirring often

1. Stir in the corn and cook for another few minutes or until the mixture comes away from
skillet while stirring, or is starting to thicken and come together.

1. Remove from heat and add half the cheese into mixture stirring it in well.  This is a good time to check and see if you need more salt and pepper after the cheese is added.  Add more if needed

1. Top with the rest of the cheese and bake for 30 minutes or until it's golden brown

1. Let stand for 15-20 minutes before cutting to allow it to set. (I don't mind mine a little runny so I dig right in)
