It really is a complete meal in a pan, and quite a satisfying one too. It's perfect served for brunch with fried or poached eggs but I can't say that I have never had this for dinner either. It's easy and although I like to cook the elements of this dish separately, it all finishes off in the same pan.

The sage and rosemary give it a beautiful flavour.  If you ask me sage and sweet potatoes are a match made in heaven. Not so much for my husband though.  Well at least if not done right.  He made us an awesome sweet potato mash with sage once but added too much sage (recipe misread) and couldn't even stand to take a bite. It's super fragrant and you don't need much to add the flavour you want.  It has a sweet savoury flavour but can also overpower and be almost pungent if you go over board.  Same with rosemary.  So in this recipe you only need a pinch of both.

In this recipe the sausage is the real star.  You don't need it if you want to keep the dish vegetarian or vegan(although you could swap it out for veggie sausages) but it really adds to this dish.  Especially if you use really good quality sausages like I did. I used [@delmanofood](https://www.instagram.com/delmanofood) English banger, vegetarian fed, preservative free, antibiotic free, filler free, gluten free and basically junk free sausages. They are soo good.  Locally homemade sausages!! They have many flavour blends.  Cannot wait to try their maple and cinnamon breakfast sausages and there chorizo and their geera, and well all the rest of them.

This is a real stick to your bones kind of breakfast.  With eggs and a side of bread, some good hot sauce or 'peppa sauce' and a good strong coffee- this will keep you for a few hours and you may require a nap after having it. Loved it and know you will too wether you have it vegetarian or with the sausages!!

Recipe for Rosemary sage sweet potato kale and sausage hash:

Serves 4 ( or 2 if you're me and my husband)
<br><br>

### Ingredients:

* 2 sweet potatoes pealed and chopped into small cubes (small because they will cook down faster)
* 4 sausages of your choice
* 1 red onion cut in half and sliced thinly
* 1 green bell pepper
* 1 bunch of kale (so 2-3 leaves) washed, thick stem removed and chopped finely
* 2 cloves of garlic minced
* 1/2 tsp of sage
* 1/2 tsp of fresh rosemary
* 2 tbsp of EVOO
* 2 tbsp of tomato ketchup (optional)
<br>

### Directions:

1. While chopping and prepping veggies heat a skillet to med/high with 1 tbsp of EVOO and pan fry your sausages until done.  Remove from pan let cool slightly and then cut into thick pieces and set aside

1. While those are cooking heat a smaller pan to med/high with 1 tbsp of EVOO and pan fry the sweet potatoes for a couple of min than add a couple tbsps of water, turn heat down to medium, cover and let simmer for a few mins checking once and a while to see if they need water. Repeat the process of adding a little water and covering to simmer a few times until they are cooked through. Takes approx 10 mins.  Once done uncover and pan fry them just enough to get a little colour on them and then take off heat and set aside.

1. Remove excess oil from sausages reserving one or two tbsp in the pan.  Heat pan and oil up and sauté your veggies starting with your green bell pepper.  Sauté for 2-5 mins, then add your red onion and kale and allow to sauté gently until caramelised, add in your garlic and sauté for a min and then your sage and rosemary and sauté them a few mins longer. Add in the potatoes and the sausages, season with S&P to taste and sauté everything for another min and now at this point I stir in my tomato ketchup and sauté everything for a final couple of minutes, and then it's ready to serve.  This is totally optional but if you decide to do it you won't regret it.  It gives everything a slightly sweet glaze.  

1. Serve hot with eggs and hot sauce and some toasted hearty bread. Warning: may induce sleep
