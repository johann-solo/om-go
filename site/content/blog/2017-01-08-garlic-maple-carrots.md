Hope everyone is having (or had depending on time zone) a great weekend! We had a great time with friends on Friday evening at a big family style dinner which had the most lovely food.  We had an assortment of salads including a really nice pasta salad.  We had stewed chicken and roasted herbed fish with stewed peas and rice. And we had the most wonderful boiled corn smothered with a creamy buttery cheesy sauce (like a paste consistency)  and encrusted with Parmesan cheese. It was wonderful!! I should really get the recipe for it. Would make a perfect side Sunday addition.  Will get on that. All was shared in really good company.  There's just nothing like enjoying food and good conversation among friends.  Feed the belly and the soul.

Last night we enjoyed some of the arts. Trinidad and Tobago have a long history of excellent artists both on canvas, and also extending beyond that.  Photography, clay, culinary as well as design and fashion.  I am not someone who knows any rules associated with any art form but I can appreciate all forms of it.  Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean you can't enjoy it.   I think I'm more art inclined than anything else myself; I just express it differently.  I believe food to be in a way an art form, as much as fashion is.  And I definitely love both.  Anyways I take any opportunity I can to see as much local art as possible (time being a big factor). I think it's fun (and it's usually free to enjoy).  Yesterday evening was particularly special because a dear friend of mine was one of the featured artists!! So I was extra impressed and of course extra proud!! My friend also creates some beautiful stoneware pieces and I cannot wait to feature my food on one of her creations. You can see her work right [here](http://www.esthergriffith.com).

> A simple and delicious no fail way of making them in a way that everyone will enjoy

Today was great as well.  I had a very long catch up Skype date with a dear friend from back home. Tears where shed, laughs were had and wine was had (at least by her). It's hard to carve out time to connect with the people you love and care about especially if they live far but I believe it's important.   It edifies you as a person and that reconnect can refocus and energise you in a way that very little else can. I know she needed to talk more than I did but what she doesn't realise is that I needed and benefited from it just as much as she did!  Moral of the story: stay connected &mdash; it's good for you!

Now to these totally addictive carrots.  I love carrots so it's super easy for me to have them any way.  But this is a simple and delicious no fail way of making them in a way that everyone will enjoy. They look gorgeous and they are buttery and sweet and just darn good! I always make extra because I know they will get devoured! Hope you guys love them as much as we do and I hope you have a great Monday!

1. Once you have removed the carrots after the 20 minutes place all the carrots on the one sheet and drizzle brown butter garlic maple mixture over them and toss. Put them back into the oven to roast for another 10 minutes or so or until the edges start to caramelize.  Remove from oven and let stand for a few minutes and serve.
