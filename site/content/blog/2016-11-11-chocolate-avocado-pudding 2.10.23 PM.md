excerpt: "<p>One of my favourites way to have an avocado? Chocolatey</p>"

I have seen these little puddings all over Pinterest and IG but I was watching [@erinireland](https://www.instagram.com/erinireland) stories last week and saw her make it and I thought 'why have I not
tried this yet!' The time came to make it when I realised I had a really ripe avocado that was beyond help other than making it into this pudding.  It was one of those avocado's that when you get it looks like a good one but it almost ripens too fast.  Anyways, I am not one to waste an avo so I thought It was time to make this silky smooth chocolate avocado pudding.   
<br>

Disclaimer: I am a fan of dark chocolate, all chocolate in fact.  But I think you must have a bit of an affinity towards dark chocolate to really enjoy this pudding.  Yes I absolutely loved it, but if you are a milk chocolate fan and a sweets fan this may not be your favourite.  That being said you can add more sweetener like honey or maple syrup to it to help.  But it's flavour is definitely more toward the darker chocolate kind.

Its silky smooth and requires very few ingredients.  And the best part is you dump all those ingredients in the food processor and presto you have your rich silky smooth chocolate pudding!!
I topped mine off with a coconut whip cream.  By the way I whipped it in the food processor because if you are following my stories you know that my mixer died on me last week.  I haven't got a new one yet so I debated whether it would work using the food processor and was surprised to find that it did.  It turns out fluffier when using the mixer though for future reference.

And the coconut milk should be refrigerated overnight to separate the milk solids/fats and the water/liquid parts.  You whip only the solids and I find that it's a great dairy whip cream substitute. Ok so here is the recipe:
<br><br>

## Chocolate avocado pudding

### Ingredients

* 2 ripe small/medium avocados or 1 very large one (Trini avo) peel off and seed out
* 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa (I used our local *trinitario* cocoa which is bomb)
* 1/4 cup of maple syrup or honey
* 1/2 tsp sea salt or pink Himalayan salt
* 1 tsp coconut oil
* 1/4 cup almond milk
<br><br>

### Directions:
* Place all ingredients in a food processor and blend to the consistency desired
<br>

Note: depending on size of avocado and ripeness you may need to adjust the amount of almond milk or cocoa to get the texture you like so feel free to add more of each if needed and that also goes for how sweet you want it too. Adjust amount of sweetener to taste.  
<br>

Serve with coconut whip on top and a sprinkle of cocoa powder. Enjoy!!!!
