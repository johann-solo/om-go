excerpt: <p>A vegan's paradise that all can enjoy</p>

It makes me super proud to see young people with big ideas succeed in a meaningful way. In just a few years the founders of the the Sweet Beet Juice Company have turned a business from the kitchen to a busy store front in Westmall.

Their ideas and philosophies stem from their personal health and wellness goals and inspired by travel and others on social media who share their same philosophies on good clean eating. Nourishing the soul with the freshest ingredients whether it be local when available or imported.
<br>

One particular thing I love about their food and drinks is that they make a lot of the add ons themselves. For example, they make their own nut butters, nut milks, cashew cream and granola (the granola and shaved coconut is sooo fantastic!!) all from scratch. They also use local honey and cocoa in many of their treats.

The space is inviting with clean simple and modern lines and appealing displays of their ingredients (fresh fruits and vegetables) in baskets, beautiful photos of local beaches and fruit and some motivational words on the walls. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and on the ball. They serve up some fresh juices, smoothies, amazing Acai bowls, salads, snacks and some sweet treats like their decadent brownies!
<br><br>

I love their food philosophy. I'm not vegan or a vegetarian and not on a completely gluten free diet but I do agree with all those food philosophies. I just can't claim them or adopt them because I am not one ... not yet at least! But if you fall into any of those categories you are going to love this place &mdash; it's a vegan paradise.

I feel strongly about sugar-filled drinks and empty-calorie snacks. That's another reason why I love this place. They sweeten with natural sugars from honey or agave nectar and you have the option of unsweetened also. You will never find anything sweetened with any kind of refined sugar, additives or preservatives. This is something you should be aware of if your expecting to have your "Carpe Diem" taste like a Starbucks/Rituals Frappacino. You're in the wrong place if you want high sugar drinks and snacks. If you want a place where you can get food and drinks that feed and nourish your body with the freshest ingredients than this place will not disappoint!

This place gets two thumbs up from me and has inspired my own smoothie and smoothie-bowl recipes. Stay tuned for those in a later post. In the meantime what are your favourite things to add to your smoothies or smoothie bowls?
