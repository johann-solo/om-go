Hello friends! I hope all of you are having a wonderful weekend! Mine was a pretty crazy weekend. A car breakdown will always make the weekend a little more hectic, and don't get me started with the first couple of days of the week car-less. Worse things could happen though, so not going to dwell on it. Besides without it I get to clock in more steps in my day which is always a good thing. Thursday is also a public holiday and I have Friday off too, so this coming week is looking up already!

Although the weekend was hectic and made a little complicated with the car breaking down it was a good cooking and eating weekend.  I have some really good stuff coming to the blog soon. Today I made and shot 5 things and they were totally yummy so it was a really productive day.  Will be doing a little more cooking this evening hopefully and photographing more tomorrow before work when I have more light.  Sometimes I wish that I had a couple of consecutive days of full days with no nights! I would get sooo much done! #bloggerlifeproblems. That's why I'm excited to have Sundays to get a lot of shooting done. I had other plans for this Sunday but without the car I was going no where!

> It's pretty perfect as far as the salad-ometer goes

Back to the food though.  We had this awesome salad for lunch today with steak! Yeah steak! When was the last time I had steak? Probably like 2 years ago! So basically we feasted for lunch today.  Anyways I got some inspo for this salad from the back of the pearl couscous package. Does anyone else check out the package recipes? Sometimes they are kind of lame but this one included beets and arugula so I had to try it.  Made my one vinaigrette using my [preserved lemons](http://oliveandmango.com/preserved-lemons) which were awesome! So glad I could finally crack them open. They are worth the month long wait. They added the right amount of kick and acidity and saltiness.

I love using this pearl couscous with anything.  It has more texture than the fluffier kind so you can 'bite in to it' more. I can literally eat a plain bowl of it buttered and with salt and pepper.  But I'm weird. This salad is fresh, springy/summery tasting. The arugula adds that beautiful slight bitterness or fire, the beets give it some beautiful sweetness, the feta gives it a salty creaminess and the walnuts give it some crunch.  Pretty perfect as far as the salad-ometer goes! Hope you enjoy it and hope you guys have a great week ahead!

### Ingredients:

* 1.5-2 cups of cooked pearl couscous

* 2-3 beets roasted peeled and diced

* 1/2 a red onion (marinated or fresh sliced very finely) *

* 1/2 inch piece of preserved lemon (pulp removed leaving the skin only) minced or just use 2 tbsp of lemon juice in the vinaigrette

* 2-3 tbsp of EVOO

* 2 tbsp red wine vinegar

* 1 cup packed of baby arugula

* 1/4 cup of crumbled feta

* 1/4 cup of walnut pieces

* Salt and Pepper to taste
<br>


### Directions

1. Preheat your over to 350, wrap your beets in foil and roast until done approx 45 minutes to 1 hour.  

1. Allow them to cool, peel and dice and set aside

1. Prepare couscous according to package directions and set aside to cool

1. Make your vinaigrette by mixing the oil, vinegar, preserved lemon or lemon juice and salt and pepper and set aside

1. For the picture I separately dressed the couscous, beets and the arugula so as to not stain everything with the beets.  You can do this or you can just toss everything together but your salad maybe pink when you serve it.

1. Top with feta nuts and marinated onions and serve.
If using fresh onions just toss with the rest of the salad components but it's worth marinating the onions in olive oil, vinegar and either some oregano or thyme for at least an hour. I marinated them while the beets were cooking and they last on your countertop covered for two days.  This not only takes the edge off the red onions, but adds some mega flavour to them and your salad.
