  kind of soup

So why farro or maybe I should start by talking about what farro actually is because I had a few of you ask me about that.  Farro is a food made up of the grains of certain wheat species &mdash; three in particular: spelt, emmer, and einkorn. It's an ancient grain and said to also be a super food, high in fiber (higher even than rice and quinoa) and an excellent source of protein and also nutritionally dense - with B vitamins, zinc, magnesium and iron.

Why do I love using it in soups salads and as a side? Simply because I love the texture and taste. It's got a lot of body, it's very hearty, and has a wonderful nutty flavour that I love. So not only is it good for you, but it tastes fabulous too.

This soup has two versions that you could make. The recipe below is the 30 minute version which I usually make and my husband makes for me when I'm sick. It's wonderful, fragrant and the broth tastes so wonderful with the sweetness of the leeks. The quick version or what I like to call my midweek version uses store-bought rotisserie chicken that you can shred up and add to your soup which cuts down the time quite a lot.  You can also use any leftover chicken as well that you might have hanging around in the fridge.

The longer version, and hands down the more flavourful version, includes making your own stock with a whole chicken, herbs and vegetable cuttings. Homemade broth and the chicken from it make this dish even more flavourful, but I don't have time to always make my own broth. I do have some frozen at times but not always.  Have no fear if you don't use homemade broth, this soup is just as hearty and delicious but the reality is that using homemade broth does elevate any dish, especially soups.

I have been feeling really run down and some sort of vicious cold virus is going around, so I totally see me making this again in the very near future. This is one of my go to soups when I'm feeling run down or feeling like something is coming on. Pure comfort in a bowl. Leeks really have a lot to do with that.  Can you tell how I feel about leeks? I talk about them a lot! But they add so much to any dish, this soup included. So I say to this recipe &mdash; 'see you very soon' and hope you do too! You won't regret it!
